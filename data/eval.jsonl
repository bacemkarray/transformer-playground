{"id": "4737", "document": "On 9 April, a Kashmiri man called Farooq Ahmed Dar was trussed to the spare tyre at the front of a jeep and driven on a five-hour journey through several villages at the head of an army convoy.\nHe had just voted in a by-election for the national parliament when he was picked up by an army patrol.\nHe was allegedly beaten before he was lashed to the vehicle with a sign saying \"This is the fate that will befall stone throwers\" pinned to his chest.\nKashmir is disputed between India and Pakistan and Indian-administered Kashmir has seen a fresh upsurge of violence in the past few months, with stone-throwing civilians pitted against military personnel.\nThe young army officer responsible, Major Leetul Gogoi, said Mr Dar was seized because he was directing a stone-throwing mob that was besieging a polling station - something denied by both Mr Dar and witnesses in the village.\nMajor Gogoi says he decided to tie Mr Dar to the jeep in a \"fraction of a moment\" and subsequently claimed it saved 12 lives. Despite the length of Mr Dar's ordeal, he argues it created \"a window to move out of the area safely\".\nThe incident was filmed and shared on social media, causing uproar in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley.\nThe use of Mr Dar as a human shield was criticised around the world. Amnesty International described it as \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment amounting to torture\".\nThe Indian government announced there would be an inquiry into the incident but on 22 May, before the inquiry had been completed, the army awarded Major Gogoi a commendation medal for, it said, his \"sustained efforts during counter-insurgency operations\".\nThis incident shows just how difficult India is finding it to keep a lid on unrest in Kashmir.\nIndian army sources have told the BBC that morale among soldiers stationed in the valley is very low. Many any soldiers are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with their role in Kashmir, saying they fear they are effectively becoming an army of occupation.\nMeanwhile, opposition to Indian rule in Kashmir appears to be deepening. That is reflected in the fact that Mr Dar was just one of 7% of eligible voters who actually voted in the by-election - the lowest turnout for decades.\n\"We are fighting a legacy of political betrayal, infiltration, rigging in local elections, cynical politics, bad governance, vested interests, religion and regional divides,\" one senior army officer in Kashmir told my colleague, Soutik Biswas, a few weeks ago.\nThe officer acknowledged how difficult it is to operate in an environment where many people want the army to withdraw and said that, despite efforts to reach out to Kashmiris, the army remains unpopular.\nThis weekend the chief of the Indian army, General Bipin Rawat, was clear why he wanted to honour Major Gogoi.  He told the Press Trust of India (PTI) that the medal was given as a way of boosting the morale of young officers.\nGen Rawat served for many years in Kashmir and, like many Indians, believes much of the opposition to Indian rule is orchestrated by Pakistan.  He described Major Gogoi's actions as an \"innovation\", arguing the armed forces have the right to self-defence and that by using Mr Dar as a human shield, he avoided the need to fire on the crowd.\n\"This is a proxy war and a proxy war is a dirty war. It is played in a dirty way. That is where innovation comes in. You fight a dirty war with innovations,\" he told PTI.\n\"People are throwing stones at us, people are throwing petrol bombs at us.

{"id": "10870", "document": "We are about to enjoy (!) the next act in the absurdist drama \"Waiting for the Fed\" (to raise interest rates again).\nTruth be told, we can be fairly sure how this scene will play out.  Once again no increase in rates.  Perhaps Godot will turn up first.\nThe Fed is holding a policy making meeting and an interest rate rise is in theory at least on the agenda.\nJanet Yellen, the Fed Chair, and her colleagues would like to get rates back to more normal levels. The Fed currently aims to keep its main policy rate (the rates banks offer to lend to each other overnight) within a range of 0.25% to 0.5%.\nThey raised it to that level in December last year, from practically zero where it had been since the depth of the financial crisis.\nBut nobody expects they will hike rates at this meeting, largely because of the very weak performance of the jobs market in May.\nThe number in employment rose by only 38,000, the fewest since September 2010. Because the US population is growing, the number of people with jobs has to rise by more than that just to keep pace. Employment growth in April was better, but still not all that strong.\nIt's true that the unemployment rate fell markedly in May, to 4.7% from 5%. But this was due to a decline in the number of people looking for work. They are counted as \"not in the labour force\" rather than unemployed, even if they would like to have a job.\nIn a recent speech, Ms Yellen described the May jobs report as disappointing and concerning. She did, however, manage to find one encouraging thing; a faster increase in average hourly earnings. After a long period in which the economic recovery has failed to have much of a favourable impact on pay it was, she said, \"a welcome indication that wage growth may finally be picking up\".\nInflation is another factor that encourages the Fed to feel it has no need to rush the next rate rise.

Summarize the following news article into one, concise sentence capturing the main point.\n\nArticle:\nWe are about to enjoy (!) the next act in the absurdist drama \"Waiting for the Fed\" (to raise interest rates again).\nTruth be told, we can be fairly sure how this scene will play out.  Once again no increase in rates.  Perhaps Godot will turn up first.\nThe Fed is holding a policy making meeting and an interest rate rise is in theory at least on the agenda.\nJanet Yellen, the Fed Chair, and her colleagues would like to get rates back to more normal levels. The Fed currently aims to keep its main policy rate (the rates banks offer to lend to each other overnight) within a range of 0.25% to 0.5%.\nThey raised it to that level in December last year, from practically zero where it had been since the depth of the financial crisis.\nBut nobody expects they will hike rates at this meeting, largely because of the very weak performance of the jobs market in May.\nThe number in employment rose by only 38,000, the fewest since September 2010. Because the US population is growing, the number of people with jobs has to rise by more than that just to keep pace. Employment growth in April was better, but still not all that strong.\nIt's true that the unemployment rate fell markedly in May, to 4.7% from 5%. But this was due to a decline in the number of people looking for work. They are counted as \"not in the labour force\" rather than unemployed, even if they would like to have a job.\nIn a recent speech, Ms Yellen described the May jobs report as disappointing and concerning. She did, however, manage to find one encouraging thing; a faster increase in average hourly earnings. After a long period in which the economic recovery has failed to have much of a favourable impact on pay it was, she said, \"a welcome indication that wage growth may finally be picking up\".\nInflation is another factor that encourages the Fed to feel it has no need to rush the next rate rise.  The latest figure for the inflation measure the Fed prefers was 1.1% in April, compared with its 2% target.\nThat it is so low reflects some transitory factors, including the strength of the dollar (which makes imported goods cheaper) and the decline in energy prices over the last two years.

{"id": "10573", "document": "Prabir Mukherjee was the curator at Eden Gardens, Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). India were playing England and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni had suggested a spinning track be prepared for the Test match.\nPitch preparation is not an exact science; in the past, \"spinning\" tracks have been prepared where the seamers have run through the Indian batting, while \"flat\" tracks have been prepared where the fast bowlers have wreaked havoc.\nThe Indian curator's favourite technique for a spinning track is to leave it underprepared.\nSpin has been India's strength for so long that it is a cliche now.\nYet visiting spinners have often been more successful than India's best - from Richie Benaud and Ashley Mallett to Lance Gibbs and Derek Underwood, and more recently, Monty Panesar and Graeme Swann.\nIt is neither illegal nor unethical to prepare a wicket to suit the home team's bowlers. It would be foolish to do otherwise.\nIf Jim Laker could claim 19 wickets on a dry Old Trafford wicket nearly half a century ago, part of the credit should go to his captain Peter May, who persuaded the groundsman into not watering the pitch in advance.  Was that unethical? Or illegal?\nThe illegal and the unethical co-exist in sport. On the cricket field, it is illegal to overstep when bowling - umpires call a 'no ball' immediately - but it isn't unethical.\nIt is unethical to claim a catch when you know that the ball has hit the ground, but it isn't illegal.\nNo-one minds a three-day Test as long as the battle between bat and ball is fascinating.\nThe curator is subject to a set of opposing demands. A quick win for the home side versus a full five-day match which is what television demands. The latter are often boring run feasts. The toss can ruin the best-laid plans of curators.\nHad South Africa made in the first innings the same score they did in the second, Nagpur might have had a different story to tell in the ongoing series against India. South Africa made more in the fourth innings than India did in the third.\nThe tracks at Mohali and Nagpur for the current series have not been minefields or square turners.\nTrue, they aided spin early, but they were the allies of batsman willing to stay and play. That 40 was the highest score in four innings at Nagpur was not so much an indictment of the pitch as of the batsmen's technique.\nNo-one expects tracks in seamer-friendly England to be like the pace-friendly ones in Australia or South Africa. Cricket's - in fact, any sport's - charm lies in the variety and range of its settings. Conditions change, challenges differ. Overcoming the opposition by conquering the conditions is the essence of the game.\nUniformity - of pitches, grounds, weather - is neither possible nor desirable.\nThe South Africans have had to deal with difficult pitches, not impossible ones.\nBatting techniques have been tested, and not just those of the visitors. Indians, who presumably ought to be happier in home conditions have displayed the same lack of technique. The shorter formats have formalised the habit of hitting your way out of trouble.

India were playing England and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni had suggested a spinning track be prepared for the Test match.\nPitch preparation is not an exact science; in the past, \"spinning\" tracks have been prepared where the seamers have run through the Indian batting, while \"flat\" tracks have been prepared where the fast bowlers have wreaked havoc.\nThe Indian curator's favourite technique for a spinning track is to leave it underprepared.\nSpin has been India's strength for so long that it is a cliche now.\nYet visiting spinners have often been more successful than India's best - from Richie Benaud and Ashley Mallett to Lance Gibbs and Derek Underwood, and more recently, Monty Panesar and Graeme Swann.\nIt is neither illegal nor unethical to prepare a wicket to suit the home team's bowlers. It would be foolish to do otherwise.\nIf Jim Laker could claim 19 wickets on a dry Old Trafford wicket nearly half a century ago, part of the credit should go to his captain Peter May, who persuaded the groundsman into not watering the pitch in advance.  Was that unethical? Or illegal?\nThe illegal and the unethical co-exist in sport. On the cricket field, it is illegal to overstep when bowling - umpires call a 'no ball' immediately - but it isn't unethical.\nIt is unethical to claim a catch when you know that the ball has hit the ground, but it isn't illegal.\nNo-one minds a three-day Test as long as the battle between bat and ball is fascinating.\nThe curator is subject to a set of opposing demands. A quick win for the home side versus a full five-day match which is what television demands. The latter are often boring run feasts. The toss can ruin the best-laid plans of curators.\nHad South Africa made in the first innings the same score they did in the second, Nagpur might have had a different story to tell in the ongoing series against India. South Africa made more in the fourth innings than India did in the third.\nThe tracks at Mohali and Nagpur for the current series have not been minefields or square turners.\nTrue, they aided spin early, but they were the allies of batsman willing to stay and play. That 40 was the highest score in four innings at Nagpur was not so much an indictment of the pitch as of the batsmen's technique.\nNo-one expects tracks in seamer-friendly England to be like the pace-friendly ones in Australia or South Africa. Cricket's - in fact, any sport's - charm lies in the variety and range of its settings. Conditions change, challenges differ. Overcoming the opposition by conquering the conditions is the essence of the game.\nUniformity - of pitches, grounds, weather - is neither possible nor desirable.\nThe South Africans have had to deal with difficult pitches, not impossible ones.\nBatting techniques have been tested, and not just those of the visitors. Indians, who presumably ought to be happier in home conditions have displayed the same lack of technique. The shorter formats have formalised the habit of hitting your way out of trouble. Test cricket demands greater discipline and more respect for the essentials of batsmanship.\nWhen Indian leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani claimed 16 wickets in his debut Test in Chennai, the visiting captain, Viv Richards of the West Indies told the Indian team: \"Come home, we'll show you,\" he said.\nThe message holds good in all sport: home rules apply.\nSuresh Menon is Editor, Wisden India Almanack\n\nSummary:"}

{"id": "7221", "document": "The four-time Tour de France winner made his breakthrough when finishing second in 2011's race to equal the then-best finish by a British rider in a Grand Tour.\nWill he go one better this year and become the third man to complete the Tour-Vuelta double in the same year - and first since the Spanish race was switched from early to late in the season 22 years ago?\nFroome goes into the race as favourite but with six of the top 10 from this year's Tour and the likes of five-time Grand Tour winner Vincenzo Nibali and Britain's Adam Yates in the mix, the Vuelta promises to be as tough as they come.\nThe race starts in Nimes in France on Saturday, 19 August and concludes in Madrid on Sunday, 10 September.\nThe youngest of the three annual Grand Tours, the Vuelta, like its cousins the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France, is a three-week race made up of 21 stages, raced over 23 days.\nPrior to 1995 the race took place earlier in the season but often clashed with other major races so was switched to after May's Giro and July's Tour.\nIt was first raced in 1935, and aside from pauses for the Spanish Civil War and World War II, it has been contested continuously since 1955.\nThe 72nd edition of the race is starting outside of Spain for just the third time after Lisbon, Portugal in 1997 and Assen, Netherlands in 2009.\nIt is often an unpredictable race with riders racing who have suffered injuries or health problems earlier in the season, or those trying to rescue a failed season, while riders like Froome are trying to maintain their form from the Tour de France.\nThe route is notoriously mountainous, as evidenced by this year's race, which features nine summit finishes.\n\"It's vicious,\" is Froome's take on it, while 2015 champion Fabio Aru says it will be the \"usual horrendous race\" and the \"toughest stage race of the 2017 season\".\nThe summit finishes are spread evenly across the three weeks with a mix of short, sharp climbs such as stage five's 3.5km ascent of Ermita Santa Lucia. It features gradients of 20%, while stage 15 finishes at an altitude of 2,510m in Sierra Nevada. The penultimate stage pits the riders against the infamous Alto de Angliru, where Sky lost the 2011 Vuelta when Froome waited for team leader Bradley Wiggins as Juan Jose Cobo launched a race-winning attack.\nAn opening team time trial in Nimes should not be long enough to create any significant time gaps between those chasing the overall victory but crucial seconds will be won and lost.\nRace organisers will hope the 40km individual time trial on stage 16 will help balance out the climbs but it could just serve to strengthen Froome's grip on the title.\nSprinter-friendly stages are few, although those that make it to the finale are rewarded with a chance of glory in Madrid.\nIn a nutshell, he can climb with the best in the race and is a better time-trial rider. He has finished runner-up on three occasions and goes into the race saying he has \"unfinished business\".\nThe 32-year-old also has arguably the strongest nine-man squad to help keep him out of trouble on flatter stages and set the pace on the tougher ascents. And, given his excellent form in the third and final week of July's Tour de France, Froome appears to have tailored his season to perfection, allowing him to also peak for the Vuelta.\nOn the eve of the race, he said: \"The plan was to have a lighter first part of the season and I think that's worked. I certainly feel fresher. But whether that's reflected in the racing we'll have to wait and see.\"\nFroome's rivals know they need to attack on ascents and descents in the mountains in the hope of picking up enough seconds to neutralise the time they will expect to lose in the 40km individual time trial.\nAnd that stage 16 is one that Froome has earmarked. \"The time trial is one day I'm looking forward to, a lot of time can be won or lost there,\" he said. \"And of course stage 20 to the Angliru is a massive stage.\"\nRomain Bardet - the AG2R La Mondiale rider was the big hope for a first French Tour winner since 1985 in July, but he knows he needs to up his time trialling skills if he is to finally win a Grand Tour.\nHe lost almost two minutes to Froome over a 22km course in Marseille in July. Bardet, who is riding in his first Vuelta, said: \"My ambitions will be different than in the Tour de France but surrounded by a strong team, I hope to make an impact on stages that suit me.\"\nFabio Aru - the Italian won this race in 2015 and will love the steep climbs. However, he too lost significant time to Froome in the Tour's time trial and is wary of the Vuelta's team test on day one. He said: \"I think I've recovered well after the Tour and have a good team with me.\nWe've got to limit the damage in the opening team time trail and be ready for the wind on Sunday. The nine uphill finishes means we'll be flat out all the time. It'll be good to watch, with time gaps each time.\"\nVincenzo Nibali - the Italian is one of six riders to have won all three Grand Tours and will be relatively fresh having missed the Tour after finishing third in the Giro.\nFroome has picked out the Bahrain-Merida rider as his main threat. However, his team is not as strong as Sky's and he too will need to attack in the mountains because he is an inferior time trialler. He said: \"I'm feeling pretty good. We'll find out how good along the road, day by day. I did a good block of training in the Dolomites that gave me the answers [about my form] that I was looking for.\"\nAlberto Contador - the 34-year-old winner of eight Grand Tours is calling time on his career after the Vuelta but insists it won't be a lap of honour round his home country.\nThe three-time Vuelta winner said: \"I have always given my maximum as a rider and I will do that now. This Vuelta is special, and I want to enjoy it. I feel lucky that I can be here, it's a really good place to say goodbye. So I want to see how the legs are feeling, see what kind of form my rivals have, but I have come with the idea of fighting to win and to enjoy it, too.\"\nAside from Froome, the Yates twins Adam and Simon provide the biggest hope of a podium finish for a British rider. The Orica-Scott pair are racing together in a Grand Tour for the first time since since the 2015 Tour de France and are part of a three-pronged attack for the Australian-based team.\nAdam finished ninth at the Giro d'Italia in May and has a best Grand Tour finish of fourth at last year's Tour de France, when he also became the first Briton to win the young rider classification. Simon won that category in this year's race, finishing seventh overall, his best in a three-week race.\nBoth are competing in a second Grand Tour in the same year for the first time but Adam is buoyant about their chances, particularly because they also have renowned climber Esteban Chaves in their squad.\n\"If we can get on the podium, that'd be great, whether it's me, or Simon or Esteban,\" he told Cycling News.\n\"Esteban is another card we can play, especially in the third week. How many teams have three guys that can potentially be top 10, or even, depending on how much everybody else is going, top five?\"\nSimon is hopeful his body will \"react in a positive way\" after \"keeping things ticking over\" since finishing the Tour in July.\n\"We'll know in the early tough stages how I'm going,\" he added. \"It depends on how my legs are. But as a team, either way, we're going to do quite well.\"\nIan Stannard is the only other Briton in Team Sky's squad and he will be tasked with helping keep Froome safe and in contention on the flatter sections.\nThe two other Britons in the race both ride for Irish team Aqua Blue Sport. Adam Blythe, the 2016 national road race champion will be looking to win sprint stages, while Mark Christian, who was seventh in the Tour de Yorkshire, is taking on his first Grand Tour.\nNo rider has won all three Grand Tours in the same year, although Belgian legend Eddy Merckx did win four on the trot, the last two in 1972 and the first two in 1973.\nOnly Frenchmen Bernard Hinault (1978) and Jacques Anquetil (1963) have won the Vuelta and Tour in the same year and they achieved that at a time when the Spanish race preceded the French one.\nIn 1995 the Vuelta was switched to post-Tour and since then only four riders have finished in the top three in both races in the same year. Froome came closest to completing the double last year when he won the Tour and finished runner-up in the Vuelta.\nThe Giro-Tour double has been achieved most often, with Merckx doing it three of the 12 times, while the Giro-Vuelta double has been done three times.\nMerckx (1973) and Italy's Giovanni Battaglin (1981) remarkably won both when they were raced with just a few days separating each Tour.

{"id": "850", "document": "How much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why.\nIt used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier.\nThis is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows.\nThen we had the financial crisis of 2008.\nThe upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them.\nFor example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of £27,000 at the age of 28, compared with £28,000 for those born in the 1970s.\nThe figure was £21,000 for those born in the 1960s and £15,000 for those born in the 1950s.\nDespite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age.\nBy their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about £27,000 each, on average.\nBy the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - £53,000 each.\nA large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither.\nAt the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s.\nHome ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30.\nSimilarly, the Local Government Association reported in December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago.\nThe lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices.\nIn their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs.\nAt the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by the decline of social housing.\nFor today's renters, it seems likely that raising a deposit is a greater barrier to home ownership than actually paying a mortgage.\nLower interest rates mean housing costs for young homeowners have fallen and they are quite likely to be paying much less than renters relative to their incomes. Mortgage interest costs for homeowners born in the early 1980s amounted to just 15% of income.\nOf course, the low interest rates that have benefitted homeowners are themselves likely to be one of the factors pushing up house prices.\nThe vast majority of young adults working in the private sector will never have pensions as generous as those enjoyed by their older colleagues.\nThis is because most employers have closed defined benefits pension schemes, which typically see employees paid a set proportion of their average or final salary when they retire.\nThe schemes that have replaced them are typically much less generous.\nIn their early thirties, fewer than one in 10 private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme.\nThis compares with nearly four out of 10 workers born in the 1960s.\nIn 2015, 90% of those in defined benefit schemes received an employer contribution equivalent to 10% of their earnings or more, compared with only 13% of those in other schemes.\nWith stalled incomes, lower home ownership and less generous pensions, it is easy to see that young adults have little to cheer about financially.\nBut those older, wealthier, generations are increasingly seen as the ones likely to provide a secure future.\nOf those people born in the 1970s, 75% have either received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis figure has grown steadily over the decades and has doubled since the 1930s, when just 38% of people expected an inheritance.\nOur data doesn't allow us to look at those born in the 1980s or 90s, but there is no reason to think this trend has not continued.\nWithin each generation, most inherited wealth goes to those who are already comparatively well-off.\nAmong the 1970s generation, nine out of 10 people whose income is in the top 20% have received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis compares with six out of 10 among those whose income is in the bottom 20%.\nData is not yet available for those born in the 80s or 90s.\nSo, for all the attention on inequality between generations, family ties mean a large chunk of the wealth held by older generations is likely to flow down to younger generations.\nBut most of that wealth will flow to those who are already well-off, potentially widening inequality within the younger generation.\nIt looks like we're heading for a future where how much wealth your parents have matters more than it used to.\nAbout this piece\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\nAndrew Hood is a senior research economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS), specialising in income, work and welfare.\nThe IFS describes itself as an independent research institute which aims to inform public debate on economics.

Mortgage interest costs for homeowners born in the early 1980s amounted to just 15% of income.\nOf course, the low interest rates that have benefitted homeowners are themselves likely to be one of the factors pushing up house prices.\nThe vast majority of young adults working in the private sector will never have pensions as generous as those enjoyed by their older colleagues.\nThis is because most employers have closed defined benefits pension schemes, which typically see employees paid a set proportion of their average or final salary when they retire.\nThe schemes that have replaced them are typically much less generous.\nIn their early thirties, fewer than one in 10 private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme.\nThis compares with nearly four out of 10 workers born in the 1960s.\nIn 2015, 90% of those in defined benefit schemes received an employer contribution equivalent to 10% of their earnings or more, compared with only 13% of those in other schemes.\nWith stalled incomes, lower home ownership and less generous pensions, it is easy to see that young adults have little to cheer about financially.\nBut those older, wealthier, generations are increasingly seen as the ones likely to provide a secure future.\nOf those people born in the 1970s, 75% have either received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis figure has grown steadily over the decades and has doubled since the 1930s, when just 38% of people expected an inheritance.\nOur data doesn't allow us to look at those born in the 1980s or 90s, but there is no reason to think this trend has not continued.\nWithin each generation, most inherited wealth goes to those who are already comparatively well-off.\nAmong the 1970s generation, nine out of 10 people whose income is in the top 20% have received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis compares with six out of 10 among those whose income is in the bottom 20%.\nData is not yet available for those born in the 80s or 90s.\nSo, for all the attention on inequality between generations, family ties mean a large chunk of the wealth held by older generations is likely to flow down to younger generations.\nBut most of that wealth will flow to those who are already well-off, potentially widening inequality within the younger generation.\nIt looks like we're heading for a future where how much wealth your parents have matters more than it used to.\nAbout this piece\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\nAndrew Hood is a senior research economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS), specialising in income, work and welfare.\nThe IFS describes itself as an independent research institute which aims to inform public debate on economics.

Belgium's court of cassation then referred the case to the EU's top court for clarification.\nThe wearing of headscarves, and more controversially the Islamic veil, has caused controversy across Europe.\nIn France, where the separation of state and religion is enshrined in law, a ban on Muslim headscarves and other \"conspicuous\" religious symbols at state schools was introduced in 2004.\nHowever, last year Germany's highest court struck down a ban on headscarves for state school teachers.\n\nSummary:"}

{"id": "2029", "document": "Some might see  the claim by care home operators that there could be a \"catastrophic collapse\"  because of the higher costs associated with the National Living Wage in such a light.\nThe residential care providers might be accused in some quarters of crying wolf after their warnings that homes might close if ministers don't agree to fund increases in the bills paid by local authorities.\nThey have written to the Chancellor George Osborne just weeks after a similarly worded missive from the UK Homecare Association, which represents providers of social care to people in their homes.\nAnd yet...

They have 28 days to appeal against their bans to the High Court.\nLast November, a panel recommended teaching bans, after concluding pupils had been \"immersed in orthodox Islamic doctrine\" through measures including the use of the school loudspeaker system to broadcast a daily call-to-prayer to Park View's pupils.\nThe panel also found while there was no formal agreement to change the character of the schools involved, there had been a co-ordinated attempt at the state-funded schools to include \"undue religious influence\".\nIt further found no evidence of Islamic \"extremism\" at work in the classrooms.\nThirteen former staff members including ex-head teachers at Park View Educational Trust (PVET) and Oldknow Academy have been facing misconduct hearings, as a result of the scandal's fallout.\nThe panel said it had heard \"credible\" evidence from a staff member who described the two men's roles as that of \"generals\" in contributing to making sure pupils were \"fed a diet of Islam\".\nThe panel also found their conduct tended to undermine tolerance and respect for the faith and belief of others.\nSeparately, Mr Anwar was also found to have breached proper recruitment procedures at Park View's sister school Nansen Primary.\nPark View, part of PVET, was at the centre of anonymous allegations which claimed there was a wider plot by Muslim hard-liners to take control of several Birmingham schools.\nThe allegations sparked investigations by several agencies, including the Department for Education and Ofsted.\nFollowing the scandal, Park View Academy was placed in special measures by Ofsted.

He was part of our culture and I used to love listening to him on the television.\"\nShe said she did not report the incident or call the police that day because she did not think anybody would believe her allegations against \"an extremely popular man\".\nThe defence lawyer asked if she had fabricated her story in the hope of making money.\nShe replied: \"Certainly not sir\" and added, \"I wouldn't choose to be here\".\nThe trial continues.\n\nSummary:"}

{"id": "1566", "document": "New by-laws will \"regulate\" camping in three zones in the park - West Loch Lomond, Trossachs (West) and Trossachs (North).\nThe authority said the plans only affected 3.7% of the national park and included investment in new facilities.\nBut the by-laws have been criticised by many outdoor recreation groups.\nThose opposed to the legislation, including Ramblers Scotland and the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, said they were concerned the laws would damage access rights.\nThe seasonal by-laws, which come into effect next year, will be active from 1 March to 30 September.\nThey will cover much of the west side of Loch Lomond, the northern tip of Loch Long and many of the Trossachs lochs, including Loch Earn, Loch Venachar and Loch Lubnaig.\nThe national park convener Linda McKay said: \"This is tremendously positive news for all those who, like us, want to protect and enhance some of Scotland's most precious natural places.\n\"These carefully-considered proposals reflect the views of a wide body of interests and demonstrate the delicate balance that needs to be struck when caring for our national parks.\"\nAs part of the plans, 300 low-cost camping places will be introduced. Some of the sites will be new or improved camping facilities and in other areas permits will be issued which will allow \"informal\" lochshore camping at \"sustainable levels\".\nThe national park said the by-laws were necessary to tackle anti-social behaviour. They will also make it an offence to cause damage to the natural environment and prevent long-term encampments in lay-bys.\nBut some outdoor groups have greeted the Scottish government announcement with \"disappointment\".\nKim Atkinson, chief executive officer of the Scottish Sports Association said: \"Our Outdoors Pursuits Group (OPG) members have always acknowledged that there are significant problems arising from certain roadside camping activities which take place along loch shores within the national park.\n\"However, our OPG remains unconvinced that by-laws are the solution, and remains concerned that they will undermine Scotland's much-prized access legislation.\"\nJess Dolan, director of Ramblers Scotland, said the new by-laws would penalise the \"vast majority\" who camped responsibly.\nShe said: \"This is a sad day for everyone who holds Scottish access rights dear.

Some of the sites will be new or improved camping facilities and in other areas permits will be issued which will allow \"informal\" lochshore camping at \"sustainable levels\".\nThe national park said the by-laws were necessary to tackle anti-social behaviour. They will also make it an offence to cause damage to the natural environment and prevent long-term encampments in lay-bys.\nBut some outdoor groups have greeted the Scottish government announcement with \"disappointment\".\nKim Atkinson, chief executive officer of the Scottish Sports Association said: \"Our Outdoors Pursuits Group (OPG) members have always acknowledged that there are significant problems arising from certain roadside camping activities which take place along loch shores within the national park.\n\"However, our OPG remains unconvinced that by-laws are the solution, and remains concerned that they will undermine Scotland's much-prized access legislation.\"\nJess Dolan, director of Ramblers Scotland, said the new by-laws would penalise the \"vast majority\" who camped responsibly.\nShe said: \"This is a sad day for everyone who holds Scottish access rights dear. The national park itself has admitted that most of the anti-social problems arising from some camping activities are caused by a lack of infrastructure and enforcement of existing legislation.\n\"Therefore we are disappointed that the minister has decided to approve by-laws, albeit with a short delay before they come into effect.\"\nMs Dolan added that Ramblers Scotland would be working to ensure the legislation was not renewed when it comes up for review in three years' time.\nAnd Dave Gibson, chief executive officer for the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, argued the national park and police already had the powers they needed to tackle lochside problems.\n\"We believe that an outcome of the by-laws will be that they will criminalise those who would otherwise wish to exercise their rights to wild camp responsibly under the terms of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003,\" he said.\n\"As such, this decision goes against the rights to responsible access provided in the act.\"\nHowever, the national park's plan has seen widespread support from residents of the park.\nRichard Graham, chairman of St Fillans Community Council, said: \"This is great news, not only for the communities who have had to put up with environmental degradation and anti-social behaviour for years, but also for the visitors who have been put off spending time in these 'no go' zones.\n\"We've seen the restorative effect that dealing with the similar issues had on East Loch Lomond and look forward to seeing families, responsible campers and visitors return to areas like ours, which have been blighted by these problems for too long.\"\nThe new by-laws are rooted in a \"Five Lochs\" study, which originally looked at problems around Loch Venachar, Loch Lubnaig, Loch Earn, Loch Achray and Loch Voil.\nThe study followed an alcohol ban and restricted camping along parts of east Loch Lomond, introduced in 2011.

But he added that they knew one thing for sure: he or she should be a Twitter user.\nMr Dorsey said the most important attribute was that they \"really use and love the product in every single way\".\nThe problem Costolo couldn't solve was how to attract new users.\nOr, at least, enough new users to keep growth-hungry Wall Street investors happy.\nAnd of the people that did sign up, analysts say they weren't being given enough reasons to stick around for very long.\nWhy did Twitter boss stand down?\nNate Elliott, an analyst at Forrester research, said the news of his departure wasn't surprising.\n\"Twitter has never been great at giving its users reasons to come back,\" said Mr Elliott.\n\"While other social sites have introduced new features and functionality the past few years, Twitter has mostly stood still.

{"id": "5599", "document": "The end of the month of fasting is marked by Eid al-Fitr, which means the \"festival of the breaking of the fast\", which continues over several days.\nThe first day of Eid starts in the UK this Friday, beginning with morning prayers, followed by feasting and celebrations with family and friends.\nRamadan is also a time for charitable deeds, which for some Muslims in the US this year has meant helping raise funds to rebuild black churches in the American South that have been devastated by fire.\nImam Zaid Shakir, an Islamic scholar at California's Zaytuna College, explained why on one of the fundraising pages.\nHe wrote that the US Muslim community understood \"the climate of racially inspired hate and bigotry that is being reignited in this country.\n\"We want to let our African American brothers and sisters know that we stand in solidarity with them during this dark hour.\"\nHowever, that sense of some communities dividing increasingly along ethnic or religious lines is one that has also been felt in parts of Europe and the UK, not least as the self-styled Islamic State (IS) and other extreme Islamist groups continue to dominate the headlines, exacerbating concerns among non-Muslims over what Islam means for some of its younger followers today.\nSome Islamic clerics around the world have used Ramadan as a chance to reflect publicly on how to reform the religious discourse within Islam to keep up with the challenges of 21st Century life, and to oppose extremism.\nIn Egypt and elsewhere, some Islamic scholars have discussed ways to renew the interpretation of the Koran, while in the United Arab Emirates, a popular American scholar of Islam warned that renewal was needed within Islam. Others stressed the necessity for a greater emphasis on tolerance of difference, mercy and mutual respect.\nThose efforts to discuss religious reform to a faith followed by around 1.6 billion people, or a quarter of the world's population, are aimed in part at ensuring that extreme interpretations of Islamic tradition do not gain a greater following.\nMilitant violence has escalated in the Middle East and elsewhere with the spread of IS. Slick online propaganda appeals to some Muslims in Europe - and to rather more young people in countries such as Tunisia or Saudi Arabia - some of whom are attracted to its austere interpretation and claim to be the \"real\" Islam.\nIn January, the Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi called for a revolution in Islam, saying that outdated interpretations had made the Muslim world a source of destruction.\nHowever, others do not want a revolution within Islam but reinterpretations, or gentler reforms.\nSpeaking in Abu Dhabi, American scholar Sheikh Hamza Yusuf urged a return to the core tenet of mercy in Islam, describing the religion as a house that had been neglected and was in need of renovation.\n\"The water taps aren't working, the plumbing's not working.

Summarize the following news article into one, concise sentence capturing the main point.\n\nArticle:\nThe end of the month of fasting is marked by Eid al-Fitr, which means the \"festival of the breaking of the fast\", which continues over several days.\nThe first day of Eid starts in the UK this Friday, beginning with morning prayers, followed by feasting and celebrations with family and friends.\nRamadan is also a time for charitable deeds, which for some Muslims in the US this year has meant helping raise funds to rebuild black churches in the American South that have been devastated by fire.\nImam Zaid Shakir, an Islamic scholar at California's Zaytuna College, explained why on one of the fundraising pages.\nHe wrote that the US Muslim community understood \"the climate of racially inspired hate and bigotry that is being reignited in this country.\n\"We want to let our African American brothers and sisters know that we stand in solidarity with them during this dark hour.\"\nHowever, that sense of some communities dividing increasingly along ethnic or religious lines is one that has also been felt in parts of Europe and the UK, not least as the self-styled Islamic State (IS) and other extreme Islamist groups continue to dominate the headlines, exacerbating concerns among non-Muslims over what Islam means for some of its younger followers today.\nSome Islamic clerics around the world have used Ramadan as a chance to reflect publicly on how to reform the religious discourse within Islam to keep up with the challenges of 21st Century life, and to oppose extremism.\nIn Egypt and elsewhere, some Islamic scholars have discussed ways to renew the interpretation of the Koran, while in the United Arab Emirates, a popular American scholar of Islam warned that renewal was needed within Islam. Others stressed the necessity for a greater emphasis on tolerance of difference, mercy and mutual respect.\nThose efforts to discuss religious reform to a faith followed by around 1.6 billion people, or a quarter of the world's population, are aimed in part at ensuring that extreme interpretations of Islamic tradition do not gain a greater following.\nMilitant violence has escalated in the Middle East and elsewhere with the spread of IS. Slick online propaganda appeals to some Muslims in Europe - and to rather more young people in countries such as Tunisia or Saudi Arabia - some of whom are attracted to its austere interpretation and claim to be the \"real\" Islam.\nIn January, the Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi called for a revolution in Islam, saying that outdated interpretations had made the Muslim world a source of destruction.\nHowever, others do not want a revolution within Islam but reinterpretations, or gentler reforms.\nSpeaking in Abu Dhabi, American scholar Sheikh Hamza Yusuf urged a return to the core tenet of mercy in Islam, describing the religion as a house that had been neglected and was in need of renovation.\n\"The water taps aren't working, the plumbing's not working. The house is in disarray,\" he told the Associated Press.\n\"You don't destroy it, you don't set it aside. You renovate it.\"\nHe said Muslims should not oppose even strong reforms, nor feel that everything needed to be changed.\n\"Because of the urgency of the situation, some people are waking up... and thinking we better do something,\" he said.\nEfforts to reform Islam are not new, and not everyone thinks they are necessary.\nBut many Muslims would agree that these are difficult times for Islam.\nFor centuries, Islamic theologians, legal experts, poets and scientists advanced not only their understanding of how Islam applied to their times, but also led global philosophical and legal debates, and discoveries in medicine and the sciences.\nIn the UK, a new Muslim video on-demand channel that launched earlier this year, focusing on Islamic life across the globe, hopes to aid better understanding of Islam in the 21st Century.\nAlchemiya is the brainchild of two British Muslims, and offers documentaries and entertainment.\nAfter the end of Ramadan, the channel will be looking for fresh funding to help it expand for a global Muslim audience.\nLondon-based imam Ajmal Masroor, one of its co-founders, says its aim is to celebrate Islam.\n\"Unfortunately, Islamic hatred has become very fashionable or acceptable today, because the media has portrayed it in this way.\n\"Every time you switch on the television, it's something about Muslims or something about terrorism, and the two have become synonymous for some people.\n\"Our channel isn't a reaction to that - our channel is a challenge to it.\"\nThe channel's appeal is that unlike many other Muslim channels, it won't focus on news or politics, but seeks to serve a new demographic: global urban Muslims (Gummies) - the growing Muslim middle-classes.\nAlchemiya's Navid Akhtar believes there is a real gap in that market, not least in Muslim majority countries such as Malaysia or Indonesia.\n\"They are really interested in what it means to be a Muslim dealing with the realities of 21st Century Islam.\n\"When I go there, they say, 'Wow, you're from London, you Muslims are so cool,' with the kind of creativity that comes out of London, the ideas we have here.

The driver sped off without checking on the girl's condition.\nOver the following minutes, 18 people walked past the bleeding toddler, and another van ran over her legs, but no-one stopped to help.\nThe distressing footage was shown on television.\nA rubbish collector who finally moved the toddler to the side of the street was hailed as a national hero, but the incident led many online commentators to question the state of Chinese morality.\nBy Martin PatienceBBC News, Foshan\nOther than the two chalk circles marked \"1\" and \"2\" on the road, there was little to suggest anything out of the ordinary.\nThe hardware stores selling irons, light fittings and taps were all open. Shopkeepers sat around chatting to each other.\nBut what happened on a covered street of this huge wholesale market last week shocked China.\nA shopkeeper close to where the incident took place said she had been sickened when she saw the footage.\n\"Every time I watch it, my heart breaks,\" said Hu Haiou. \"I catch the news every night to see if she'll survive. The people who walked by were shameful.\"\nAnother shopkeeper, Chen Guilin, said it had been raining hard the night of the incident.\n\"The raindrops sounded like drumbeats on the roof,\" she said, \"We had no idea what happened outside.\"\nPassers-by were 'shameful'\nA spokesman for the hospital told the AFP news agency that Wang Yue had died of \"systemic organ failure\", adding that no expense had been spared to try to save the girl, whose parents are migrant workers.\nThere have been millions of internet comments about how to encourage good Samaritans - and many more expressing outrage that so many people refused to help.\nHer death was one of the most remarked on topics on China's Weibo  - a micro-blogging site similar to Twitter - on Friday as people expressed sorrow and anger over the incident.\n\"Farewell to little Wang Yue. There are no cars in heaven,\" wrote one micro-blogger.\nGuangdong province is debating the introduction of a law to force people to help others in obvious distress.\nInitial online polls, though, suggest most people are against it.\n\"Talk about being civilised first.

{"id": "8328", "document": "Wales is leading the way among the UK nations and is aiming to become  one of the top recycling nations.\nBut Llanelli AM Lee Waters said the push to achieve targets could create \"unintended consequences\".\nThe Welsh Government said there was no evidence waste collection frequency changes led to more fly-tipping.\nMr Waters said Carmarthenshire council was doing things with \"the best of intentions\" but which were having \"knock-on consequences\", such as a policy involving the collection of just four bin bags every fortnight.\n\"Some families are trying to get around that by putting their bin bags in front of neighbours' houses,\" he said.\n\"And when that's being reported, they're being prosecuted, quite rightly, but to avoid that they are then fly-tipping,\" he said.\nMr Waters said Carmarthenshire has some of the best recycling rates in the country but now it was time to tackle \"the hard bits\", including people who do not want to co-operate.\n\"But I think there's a judgement for us all to reach about how far do we want to push this because, if we push it too far, too fast, we're going to create unintended consequences,\" he said.\n\"So, we may well hit our litter targets but we'll also create fly-tipping problems and broader littering problems which will increase costs.\"\nChristine Clarke, who lives near Llanelli town centre, has experienced problems with people dumping black bag waste in the lane behind her house.\n\"It's been horrendous,\" she said. \"We've had rats running around and it's not just this lane, it's all the back lanes in Llanelli.\"\nA Carmarthenshire council spokesman said fly-tipping was not unique to Llanelli, however, it was \"working hard\" to address issues there.\nHe said: \"Although generally street cleanliness is good, there are hotspot areas in the town centre, such as the rear lanes which are prone to fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour.\n\"Unfortunately, as soon as they are cleaned up, it is not long before they are back in the same mess yet again.\"\nA new taskforce will meet for the first time next month, with the aim of bringing together environmental and enforcement officers, councillors and police in finding a long-term solution.\nOther areas in Wales are seeing similar problems, such as Conwy county where many residents are said to be unhappy with the council's decision to move away from a fortnightly general waste collection to one every three weeks.\nClwyd West Conservative AM Darren Millar said: \"When bin collections were fortnightly, support was good and Conwy increased its recycling rates so it became one of the best in the country - all credit to the council for that.\n\"Unfortunately, there's less support now due to that increasing to collections every three or four weeks, which is having disastrous consequences as we're experiencing a massive increase in roadside litter and fly-tipping.\n\"In addition, there are issues now with people burning waste and pest control.\"\nA Conwy council spokesman said: \"Three-weekly refuse bin collections and a trial of four-weekly bin collections were introduced in Conwy from September.\n\"The move came after a study found that more than half the items placed in wheelie bins in the county should have been recycled - wasting Â£1.6m every year.\n\"If residents have piles of extra bin bags that won't fit in their bin, as part of the trial we visit households on an individual basis to find out what's in them and how we can help.\"\nIn an attempt to improve recycling rates in Swansea, the council has a three black-bags-per-household policy for its fortnightly collections.\nSwansea council said, in general, it had \"no significant issues\" with people being able to keep within the three-bag limit, with an increase in recyclable domestic waste collected and a reduction in black bag waste.\nBut since many dumps in the local authority stopped taking black bag waste last year, some claim this could increase fly-tipping.\nThere is also evidence litter bins are being used to deposit household waste.

Summarize the following news article into one, concise sentence capturing the main point.\n\nArticle:\nWales is leading the way among the UK nations and is aiming to become  one of the top recycling nations.\nBut Llanelli AM Lee Waters said the push to achieve targets could create \"unintended consequences\".\nThe Welsh Government said there was no evidence waste collection frequency changes led to more fly-tipping.\nMr Waters said Carmarthenshire council was doing things with \"the best of intentions\" but which were having \"knock-on consequences\", such as a policy involving the collection of just four bin bags every fortnight.\n\"Some families are trying to get around that by putting their bin bags in front of neighbours' houses,\" he said.\n\"And when that's being reported, they're being prosecuted, quite rightly, but to avoid that they are then fly-tipping,\" he said.\nMr Waters said Carmarthenshire has some of the best recycling rates in the country but now it was time to tackle \"the hard bits\", including people who do not want to co-operate.\n\"But I think there's a judgement for us all to reach about how far do we want to push this because, if we push it too far, too fast, we're going to create unintended consequences,\" he said.\n\"So, we may well hit our litter targets but we'll also create fly-tipping problems and broader littering problems which will increase costs.\"\nChristine Clarke, who lives near Llanelli town centre, has experienced problems with people dumping black bag waste in the lane behind her house.\n\"It's been horrendous,\" she said. \"We've had rats running around and it's not just this lane, it's all the back lanes in Llanelli.\"\nA Carmarthenshire council spokesman said fly-tipping was not unique to Llanelli, however, it was \"working hard\" to address issues there.\nHe said: \"Although generally street cleanliness is good, there are hotspot areas in the town centre, such as the rear lanes which are prone to fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour.\n\"Unfortunately, as soon as they are cleaned up, it is not long before they are back in the same mess yet again.\"\nA new taskforce will meet for the first time next month, with the aim of bringing together environmental and enforcement officers, councillors and police in finding a long-term solution.\nOther areas in Wales are seeing similar problems, such as Conwy county where many residents are said to be unhappy with the council's decision to move away from a fortnightly general waste collection to one every three weeks.\nClwyd West Conservative AM Darren Millar said: \"When bin collections were fortnightly, support was good and Conwy increased its recycling rates so it became one of the best in the country - all credit to the council for that.\n\"Unfortunately, there's less support now due to that increasing to collections every three or four weeks, which is having disastrous consequences as we're experiencing a massive increase in roadside litter and fly-tipping.\n\"In addition, there are issues now with people burning waste and pest control.\"\nA Conwy council spokesman said: \"Three-weekly refuse bin collections and a trial of four-weekly bin collections were introduced in Conwy from September.\n\"The move came after a study found that more than half the items placed in wheelie bins in the county should have been recycled - wasting Â£1.6m every year.\n\"If residents have piles of extra bin bags that won't fit in their bin, as part of the trial we visit households on an individual basis to find out what's in them and how we can help.\"\nIn an attempt to improve recycling rates in Swansea, the council has a three black-bags-per-household policy for its fortnightly collections.\nSwansea council said, in general, it had \"no significant issues\" with people being able to keep within the three-bag limit, with an increase in recyclable domestic waste collected and a reduction in black bag waste.\nBut since many dumps in the local authority stopped taking black bag waste last year, some claim this could increase fly-tipping.\nThere is also evidence litter bins are being used to deposit household waste. Litter bins in Penllergaer, for example, now have stickers on them warning people not to dump their black bags inside.\nLocal councillor Wendy Fitzgerald said: \"You've got to be aware that three bags is not going to suit everyone all of the time and the fact that, in most places you can't dispose of any excess black bags in the local amenities site, is going to encourage people to dispose of their bags improperly.\"\nThe Welsh Government said it made \"no apologies\" for its commitment to increasing recycling.\n\"By recycling more we reduce the need to use natural resources, decrease the need for landfill and save money,\" a spokesman added.\n\"We are already making excellent progress.

Sorry, I'm not going to say!\"\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner called Mercedes \"stand-out favourites\" on the first day of the test. Nothing that happened over the next three days made it feel like that analysis needed to be revised.\nFerrari's Sebastian Vettel left the test with the fastest time - a one minute 22.801 seconds lap set on the second day on the new ultra-soft tyre. Indeed, Ferrari were fastest on three of the four days.\nVettel's time was two seconds quicker than Mercedes' best, set by Rosberg on the medium tyre, which Pirelli estimates to be in the region of 1.8-2.3 seconds slower than the ultra-soft around Barcelona.\nIn isolation, that makes it appear as if Ferrari were pretty even with Mercedes, even if other teams were not as impressed by Vettel's time as you might expect at face value.\nNow, let's state before we get too far into this that it is notoriously difficult to draw firm conclusions from pre-season testing times, especially the headline fastest laps.\nThat's because there are so many variables - fuel load, usage of the DRS overtaking aid, circuit conditions, engine mode, different tyres. The list is endless.\nBut ex-Jordan, Jaguar and Stewart technical director Gary Anderson used to say that you could get a reasonable idea by looking at the fastest times set by each car and factoring in the tyre used and the fuel needed for the length of the run on which the time was set.\nIn other words, you might not know the exact fuel load the car is carrying, but you know the minimum it must have. It might well be carrying more, but at least it probably gets you closer to the reality.\nSo, for example, Vettel's best lap was set on a three-lap run; Rosberg's a 17-lap stint.\nFactor in that and the tyres, and you end up with figures that suggest the Mercedes is in the region of 0.5-0.6secs quicker than the Ferrari. About the same as last year, in other words.\nThat raises the question of whether Vettel's lap went well, in terms of driving, tyre preparation and so on.\nI'm told that, surprisingly, the ultra-soft tyre lasted for the entire lap, despite Barcelona being far tougher on tyres than the tracks it was designed for.\nDoes that mean Vettel went too carefully on the tyre and did not get the best out of it early in the lap? And was that a better or worse approach than heating it up more and potentially having it lose its edge by the last sector? We can't know.\nWhat we do know is that Vettel had a decent feeling on the lap.\nWhatever the intricacies of lap-time comparisons from the outside, the teams have much more data at hand and will already have a decent picture of where they stand.\nFerrari, BBC Sport understands, feel they have definitely closed in on Mercedes - not to the extent of catching them, perhaps, but their information at this stage is that the gap is smaller than it was.\nForce India, Williams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso all appear to be in decent shape - and probably not a million miles away from where they were last year.\nIf we play the fuel-and-tyre correction game with the best lap times by all teams over the four days, we get a list that looks like this, for what it's worth:\nForce India had a particularly good test, looking both fast and reliable, and the first indications are that Toro Rosso may well start the season ahead of their parent team - perhaps not surprisingly, given that they are now using a Ferrari engine and Red Bull have stuck with Renault.\nHowever, Renault does appear to have made significant progress with its engine over the winter. The word on the street is that it is as much as 50bhp more powerful. That's a very useful upgrade and would take Renault up to around the magic 900bhp figure.\nThat's probably something like 50bhp short of where Mercedes will be, with Ferrari somewhere in between and probably closer to Mercedes' 950bhp than Renault's 900bhp. But it may even be close enough for a typically excellent Red Bull chassis to get in the mix at places like Monaco, Hungary and Singapore.\nThat engine progress could also be partly responsible for a better-than-expected showing by the works Renault.\nTheir expectations were very low heading into testing, after taking over only in December a Lotus team that have been starved of resource over the last two  years.\nBut the car ran well in testing, Kevin Magnussen setting the second fastest time on the final day, and trackside operations director Alan Permane said: \"The design and manufacturing teams at Enstone have done an incredible job. The aero development work we have done has worked very well and the car is a good step up on last year's aerodynamically.\"\nThe new US-based Haas team also impressed - with strong reliability and decent pace. They have huge advantages thanks to their close links with Ferrari but to perform so well at their first test bodes well.\nThe week started reasonably well for McLaren-Honda, with Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button both able to do plenty of mileage on the first two days.\nNot only that, but McLaren appear to have made a step forward with what was already a pretty good chassis. Alonso and Button were both in the top-three fastest in the twisty final sector on the first two days. And Alonso went as far as to say: \"I think the target of having the best car, the best chassis, is reachable and very possible by the European races, and motivation is very high.\"\nAlonso also said the latest Honda engine had more power and Button said the problem of hybrid energy deployment, which was very poor in 2015, had been pretty much fixed.\nBut more power is not the same as enough power. Fixing the deployment will be a massive boost, especially in races. But the Honda is reputed to be as much as 100bhp down on the Mercedes - and seeing the McLaren rooted to the bottom of the speed-trap times suggests that's probably not far wrong.\nLater in the test, reliability deserted Honda, too, with Alonso's second day wrecked by engine problems.\nHonda has a new engine coming for the second test and it is expected to be a reasonably significant improvement. A lot of engine development is allowed during the season, but Honda needs to make the most of it if two great drivers are not to be wasted for a second year.\nMid-way through testing, a swingeing set of rule changes was announced, for both this year and next.\nPlans to have faster cars for 2017 took a major step forward with the confirmation of bodywork dimensions, and BBC Sport revealed on Thursday that Pirelli is to be mandated to produce more durable tyres on which drivers can push flat-out.\nFor this year, there will be a new elimination-style qualifying format.\nOfficially, the teams have gone away to analyse it to make sure there are no unintended consequences, but senior sources say they expect it to go through pretty much untouched other than a few tweaks here and there.\nThe drivers were equivocal about it - and Hamilton less keen than that.

{"id": "3754", "document": "The last week of Yvette Cooper's leadership campaign isn't exactly how she predicted it.\nShe has spent more time in Parliament than on the stump. As shadow home secretary she has been leading her party's response to the refugee crisis - initially calling on the government to do more, and now pressing for some of those families who have already fled to Europe to be resettled here.\nThis has helped, rather than harmed, her leadership chances but has also meant more conventional campaigning has had to be discarded.\n\"I tend to respond most strongly to the most serious issues but I'm trying to keep this apart from the leadership contest, and trying to get cross party agreement to an appropriate response to the refugee crisis,\" she tells me.\nWhile I met her rivals \"on the road\" at rallies and meetings, we meet in her parliamentary office.\nShe was on the front bench for David Cameron's statement on Monday, then was granted her own emergency debate on the crisis on Tuesday, and had sat alongside Harriet Harman - for whom she worked when Labour was in opposition in the 1990s - for her last Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.\nShe still hopes to be taking over from her old boss when Labour's new leader is announced on Saturday but her team admits it will be an uphill struggle. She seems to be ending the campaign strongly, but has she left it too late?\n\"The next week will define the next ten years' she declares.\n\"My message now is look, we lost in 2015, it's really hard to win general elections -we need the best chance of doing so and a lot of people who depend on us will be let down if we veer away from the challenges of the future and look back to our party's history.\"\nTranslated, that is please don't back Jeremy Corbyn. But she admits that her campaign got off to a slow start.\n\"Some people were planning their leadership campaigns for a long time.  I wasn't.\n\"We were doing things from scratch. In the first month of the campaign I found it hard to come out of the shadow of the general election which we were so devastated at losing.  I would go to meetings and people were just on the floor.\"\nBut, she says, she has been consistent throughout her campaign in arguing for high quality manufacturing jobs, doubling investment in science,  and for free childcare.\nSo what brought her into politics in the first place?\n\"My dad  (Tony) was a full time trade unionist. My mother came from a mining community so it was a Labour family but we didn't talk about party politics - we talked about issues and ideas.\n\"I first got involved campaigning against Section 28 (Conservative legislation that banned promotion of homosexuality a a 'pretended family relationship' in schools in England) -and I went with my Dad on the People's March for Jobs when I was 12 or 13.\"\nShe was born in 1969 so her teenage years were spent under Margaret Thatcher's government.\nBut she didn't just rebel against the Conservative administration. She said she shunned CND and has always been a multilateralist - \"that was a controversial thing to be as a teenager in the eighties\" - and it put her out of step with Labour's policy at the time.\nIf Jeremy Corbyn wins the party leadership, she might find herself a rebel again. 'At least I have been consistent!' she says with a smile.\nShe has said she would consider challenging the current government's forthcoming legislation on trade unions in the courts and revealed she had been involved in strike action herself as a youngster -at Eggar's comprehensive (now a specialist science school) in Hampshire.\n\"I organised a prefect's strike - one of the boys was facing the sack for wearing white socks to school.\"\nI ventured that this sounded like a very sensible educational establishment.\n'Yes, the socks were awful - but we showed solidarity. We were supposed to be patrolling the school but we huddled in a classroom one lunchtime instead because of Andrew's socks.\"\nWhile she had a happy childhood, she struggled early in her working life. At 24, while at Westminster working with Harriet Harman and Labour's Treasury team, she contracted ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome. It shaped her views on welfare.\n\"It was a miserable time, I had 'flu and it just didn't go away. I  couldn't work for 12 months - I hated every minute of it and I was desperate to get back to my job.\n\"I had to claim benefits - if I hadn't I wouldn't have been able to pay the rent. It taught me you never know when things will go wrong.\n\"The benefits system can promote work and responsibility but must also show respect to people. Attacking people as scroungers or workshy is deeply wrong.\"\nShe recovered and went to work as  Independent's economics correspondent before becoming an MP in 1997 - as one of the 101 women who were elected under Tony Blair's leadership, and eight years before her husband Ed Balls.\nBut she would have to wait until Gordon Brown moved from Number 11 to Number 10 Downing Street before she was promoted from a series of ministerial posts to the cabinet - as Chief Secretary to the Treasury then Work and Pensions Secretary.\nAnd it's Labour's attitude to welfare that might determine her future now. She argued with Harriet Harman that Labour should oppose the government's Welfare Bill.\nIn the end, the party laid an down an amendment then abstained.\nHer leadership rival Jeremy Corbyn got credit with some party members for rebelling and demonstrating outright opposition.\nAndy Burnham saw this as a turning point in Corbyn's fortunes. I wondered if she agreed. She didn't quite go that far, but clearly felt the episode hadn't exactly been helpful.\n\"To be honest it was a complete mess. I always felt we should oppose the bill. It included the abolition of child poverty targets that I had worked hard to establish in the first place.\n\"It also included what I call 'the children's tax' - if you have three children and are in work, then - with withdrawal of tax credits - you can be worse off. But we ended up with this messy compromise. We ended with people being confused about what we stood for.\"\nIf she feels so strongly about this, why didn't she follow Jeremy Corbyn in to the 'No' lobby?\n\"If I am leader  I will keep it clean and simple - we oppose so much of what's in the bill, we should just vote against it. But if you are in the shadow cabinet you have to try to hold the parliamentary party together but I have to say we got it wrong.\"\nJust as the welfare row boosted Jeremy Corbyn's campaign, Yvette Cooper seemed to gain more definition and passion when she decided to speak out against him.\nShe still says it is highly unlikely she would serve in his shadow cabinet.\n\"I agree with Jeremy we need an alternative to Tory austerity, but I have key important differences - our membership of the EU, and NATO (she is strongly in favour of both), printing money when the economy is growing (Jeremy Corbyn's plan to get the Bank of England to increase the money supply to invest in infrastructure).\"\n\"There are disagreements with him on these issues and it would be hard to be part of collective responsibility in his shadow cabinet.\n\"I won't take my bat and ball away - I will campaign for Labour to win elections. There has always been debate in our party ever since Marxists and Methodists came together to form it but sometimes there are things you just can't compromise on.\"\nAnd if he wins, she warns, \"people will feel let down -some of the things he promises, he can't deliver, But he will also let people down because he won't win an election\".\nIf she defies the odds and has a late surge in support, what would her priorities be?\nWell, she would undertake another rewrite of the totemic Clause IV of the party's constitution. Critics might see this as a gimmick.\n\"Clause IV is about our values as a party. It does talk about equality of opportunity. But it's not clear enough about fighting inequality which is becoming a real challenge for our economy and society.\"\nShe says she would relish taking David Cameron on, but as well as offering robust opposition she would begin developing \"long term plans for our future\".\nBut she would also face more immediate challenges. Would she support drone strikes against Britain's enemies - even if that includes British jihadis?\n\"Every country has to be able to defend itself and prevent imminent terrorist attacks but there must be a proper legal framework around it and safeguards in place.\"\nAs for the death of 21-year-old Reyaad Khan in Syria: \"There needs to be a full review by the Intelligence and Security committee and the  independent reviewer of terrorist legislation, David Anderson, should look at the details of this case.\"\nThe prime minister raised the prospect of military action in Syria at this week's PMQs - and she says she is still sceptical.\n\"I supported the action in Iraq as the democratically elected government asked for support.\n\"In Syria you have ISIL and Assad and it's not clear what the government's objectives are. The challenge for the government is to define the legal framework, the level of support in the region, and their overall strategy.\"\nHer own strategy and level of support will come under scrutiny this Saturday - she is now battling to lead her party, but may have allowed Jeremy Corbyn to steal a march earlier in the summer.", "reference": "In the fourth of a series of in-depth profiles of the Labour leadership candidates, Iain Watson catches up with Yvette Cooper.", "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

She seems to be ending the campaign strongly, but has she left it too late?\n\"The next week will define the next ten years' she declares.\n\"My message now is look, we lost in 2015, it's really hard to win general elections -we need the best chance of doing so and a lot of people who depend on us will be let down if we veer away from the challenges of the future and look back to our party's history.\"\nTranslated, that is please don't back Jeremy Corbyn. But she admits that her campaign got off to a slow start.\n\"Some people were planning their leadership campaigns for a long time.  I wasn't.\n\"We were doing things from scratch. In the first month of the campaign I found it hard to come out of the shadow of the general election which we were so devastated at losing.  I would go to meetings and people were just on the floor.\"\nBut, she says, she has been consistent throughout her campaign in arguing for high quality manufacturing jobs, doubling investment in science,  and for free childcare.\nSo what brought her into politics in the first place?\n\"My dad  (Tony) was a full time trade unionist. My mother came from a mining community so it was a Labour family but we didn't talk about party politics - we talked about issues and ideas.\n\"I first got involved campaigning against Section 28 (Conservative legislation that banned promotion of homosexuality a a 'pretended family relationship' in schools in England) -and I went with my Dad on the People's March for Jobs when I was 12 or 13.\"\nShe was born in 1969 so her teenage years were spent under Margaret Thatcher's government.\nBut she didn't just rebel against the Conservative administration. She said she shunned CND and has always been a multilateralist - \"that was a controversial thing to be as a teenager in the eighties\" - and it put her out of step with Labour's policy at the time.\nIf Jeremy Corbyn wins the party leadership, she might find herself a rebel again. 'At least I have been consistent!' she says with a smile.\nShe has said she would consider challenging the current government's forthcoming legislation on trade unions in the courts and revealed she had been involved in strike action herself as a youngster -at Eggar's comprehensive (now a specialist science school) in Hampshire.\n\"I organised a prefect's strike - one of the boys was facing the sack for wearing white socks to school.\"\nI ventured that this sounded like a very sensible educational establishment.\n'Yes, the socks were awful - but we showed solidarity. We were supposed to be patrolling the school but we huddled in a classroom one lunchtime instead because of Andrew's socks.\"\nWhile she had a happy childhood, she struggled early in her working life. At 24, while at Westminster working with Harriet Harman and Labour's Treasury team, she contracted ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome. It shaped her views on welfare.\n\"It was a miserable time, I had 'flu and it just didn't go away. I  couldn't work for 12 months - I hated every minute of it and I was desperate to get back to my job.\n\"I had to claim benefits - if I hadn't I wouldn't have been able to pay the rent. It taught me you never know when things will go wrong.\n\"The benefits system can promote work and responsibility but must also show respect to people. Attacking people as scroungers or workshy is deeply wrong.\"\nShe recovered and went to work as  Independent's economics correspondent before becoming an MP in 1997 - as one of the 101 women who were elected under Tony Blair's leadership, and eight years before her husband Ed Balls.\nBut she would have to wait until Gordon Brown moved from Number 11 to Number 10 Downing Street before she was promoted from a series of ministerial posts to the cabinet - as Chief Secretary to the Treasury then Work and Pensions Secretary.\nAnd it's Labour's attitude to welfare that might determine her future now. She argued with Harriet Harman that Labour should oppose the government's Welfare Bill.\nIn the end, the party laid an down an amendment then abstained.\nHer leadership rival Jeremy Corbyn got credit with some party members for rebelling and demonstrating outright opposition.\nAndy Burnham saw this as a turning point in Corbyn's fortunes. I wondered if she agreed. She didn't quite go that far, but clearly felt the episode hadn't exactly been helpful.\n\"To be honest it was a complete mess. I always felt we should oppose the bill. It included the abolition of child poverty targets that I had worked hard to establish in the first place.\n\"It also included what I call 'the children's tax' - if you have three children and are in work, then - with withdrawal of tax credits - you can be worse off. But we ended up with this messy compromise. We ended with people being confused about what we stood for.\"\nIf she feels so strongly about this, why didn't she follow Jeremy Corbyn in to the 'No' lobby?\n\"If I am leader  I will keep it clean and simple - we oppose so much of what's in the bill, we should just vote against it. But if you are in the shadow cabinet you have to try to hold the parliamentary party together but I have to say we got it wrong.\"\nJust as the welfare row boosted Jeremy Corbyn's campaign, Yvette Cooper seemed to gain more definition and passion when she decided to speak out against him.\nShe still says it is highly unlikely she would serve in his shadow cabinet.\n\"I agree with Jeremy we need an alternative to Tory austerity, but I have key important differences - our membership of the EU, and NATO (she is strongly in favour of both), printing money when the economy is growing (Jeremy Corbyn's plan to get the Bank of England to increase the money supply to invest in infrastructure).\"\n\"There are disagreements with him on these issues and it would be hard to be part of collective responsibility in his shadow cabinet.\n\"I won't take my bat and ball away - I will campaign for Labour to win elections. There has always been debate in our party ever since Marxists and Methodists came together to form it but sometimes there are things you just can't compromise on.\"\nAnd if he wins, she warns, \"people will feel let down -some of the things he promises, he can't deliver, But he will also let people down because he won't win an election\".\nIf she defies the odds and has a late surge in support, what would her priorities be?\nWell, she would undertake another rewrite of the totemic Clause IV of the party's constitution. Critics might see this as a gimmick.\n\"Clause IV is about our values as a party. It does talk about equality of opportunity. But it's not clear enough about fighting inequality which is becoming a real challenge for our economy and society.\"\nShe says she would relish taking David Cameron on, but as well as offering robust opposition she would begin developing \"long term plans for our future\".\nBut she would also face more immediate challenges. Would she support drone strikes against Britain's enemies - even if that includes British jihadis?\n\"Every country has to be able to defend itself and prevent imminent terrorist attacks but there must be a proper legal framework around it and safeguards in place.\"\nAs for the death of 21-year-old Reyaad Khan in Syria: \"There needs to be a full review by the Intelligence and Security committee and the  independent reviewer of terrorist legislation, David Anderson, should look at the details of this case.\"\nThe prime minister raised the prospect of military action in Syria at this week's PMQs - and she says she is still sceptical.\n\"I supported the action in Iraq as the democratically elected government asked for support.\n\"In Syria you have ISIL and Assad and it's not clear what the government's objectives are. The challenge for the government is to define the legal framework, the level of support in the region, and their overall strategy.\"\nHer own strategy and level of support will come under scrutiny this Saturday - she is now battling to lead her party, but may have allowed Jeremy Corbyn to steal a march earlier in the summer.\n\nSummary:"}

But you can't blame Lee Grant for that.\nI don't think I saw Manchester City winger Jesus Navas go past Walker once in the 65 minutes he was on the pitch, and eventually Walker saw him off.\nWalker is so full of running and confidence at the moment it's scary. It was his interception that started the move that resulted in Tottenham's penalty.\nI must say Walker's athleticism reminds me of my former team-mate, ex-Spurs and England full-back Danny Thomas. Now there was an athlete.\nAlderweireld was outstanding against Manchester City. His tackle on Fernandinho five minutes into the second half was a statement of intent. It was a clear that Spurs were determined to start the second half the way they had finished the first and that was to remain totally in control of the match.\nLast season when Spurs went on their impressive run of games, it was Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen who stood out at the back. They now have Kyle Walker and Danny Rose alongside them and both have a year's more experience under their belts. Let's see if it makes a difference.\nThis was a Tottenham side without Harry Kane or Mousa Dembele and they still managed to batter Manchester City. The main reason was due to the performance of the two centre-backs, Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld.\nI would never have believed that Spurs could have kept a clean sheet against City the way they have been playing this season under Pep Guardiola. Granted, City were without their talisman Kevin de Bruyne but if Guardiola hadn't been so obstinate and hard-headed, he'd have left the door open for Yaya Toure to return to the team and who knows what might have happened.\nNo Manchester City manager, however celebrated, can have a player of Toure's ability and justify his exclusion with a result, not to mention a performance, like this.\nA player with a cool head and a decent right foot is quite capable of digging a team out of a very tight situation - and that is precisely what Milner did with his re-enactment of the Antonin Panenka penalty kick. Of course, there will be a generation of youngsters who will begin to copy the technique without having a Scooby Doo where the idea originated or under what circumstances.\nHowever, none of that will interest Swansea manager Francesco Guidolin whose team continue to play well but are destroying their chances of survival in the Premier League by panicking in their own penalty area.\nWhat will help Guidolin is understanding the basic principle that it doesn't matter if you are Milner or Panenka, if you can't handle the pressure you can't possibly be successful at the highest level.\nWhat a wonderful finish by Willian against Hull City. The Brazilian was voted Chelsea's best player last season and quite rightly. He seldom misses a game through injury and provides a touch of class in the Chelsea midfield to complement the more energetic members of the engine room like Nemanja Matic and N'Golo Kante.\nMy only criticism with him is that he doesn't make a fuss. A typical example of this was when Hull centre-back Curtis Davies clearly chopped Willian down in the penalty area and referee Anthony Taylor waved play on.\nWillian raised his arms in disbelief - a reaction I have seen before from him when a clear miscarriage of justice has occurred - but, in my view, it is not enough. Players know when a referee has got something badly wrong and not bringing it to his attention does you no favours.\nKante might not be the finest finisher in the world - in fact, he's not a finisher at all - and that point was clearly demonstrated in the game against Hull. In the end, Chelsea beat the Tigers comfortably but it was the running power of Kante that provided the platform for a very important victory for manager Antonio Conte that stopped the side's run of defeats.\nKante is every footballer's dream team-mate. Anyone who can put in the amount of unselfish running Kante provides each week should be rewarded by his team-mates with a percentage of their bonuses.\n\"Could this be his moment?\" asked BBC commentator Jonathan Pearce. Well, it certainly was. France international Payet waltzed around five Middlesbrough defenders before calmly planting the ball past keeper Victor Valdes. What a fabulous goal.\nThe problem with West Ham is that they can't keep relying on Payet by waiting for a moment of inspiration or a wonder goal to pull them out of the mire. The Hammers may have the passion of Mark Noble and the commitment of Winston Reid but they need a genuine goalscorer to share the load with Payet if they intend to retain their status in the top flight.\nIf Andy Carroll can stay fit for a decent run of games, that might do the trick.\nThe more I see Deeney, the more I start asking myself \"why has this lad not been selected for England?\" His performances for Watford were immense last season and he appears to be having the same impact on his team again.

Does it work? You bet your sweet life it does.\nSon is mobile, sees the pass and is capable of playing it. The through ball for Dele Alli to score was simply world-class and the sort you would expect from a Luka Modric or an Ivan Rakitic.\nThe only flaw in this otherwise superb team performance was that Son and Erik Lamela found themselves squabbling like a couple of schoolchildren in a playground over who was taking the penalty.\nIf Spurs have any chance of doing themselves justice in any of the competitions this season, then all their players need to behave in the best interests of the team and not themselves.

This can be used to identify a landmark, for example, or tell the owner how much a product would cost to buy online.\nBixby works with Google Play Music, and Samsung intends to open it up to other third-party apps in the future but has not said when.\nAt launch, it is only designed to recognise US and Korean voices.\n\"If what Samsung demoed works well in practice, Bixby will be interesting because it offers features absent from Siri and Google Assistant,\" commented Francisco Jeronimo from IDC.\n\"The race is on to have the best digital assistant, since that will drive hardware sales.\n\"But in the past, some of Samsung's features have looked great in presentations, but when you use them on a daily basis they have not been as good.\"\nWhile Bixby offers new ways to control a phone, it lacks Google Assistant's pre-emptive smarts - it does not interject in chats to suggest places to visit, for example.\nHowever, the search giant's rival artificial intelligence can still be summoned via the home button.\nOther improvements over last year's models include:\nSamsung also has a range of accessories including a revamped virtual reality headset that is now accompanied by its own motion-sensing controller, and a second-generation 360-degree camera capable of more detailed images than before.\nIt also offers a new dock that connects the phones to a monitor, keyboard and wireless mouse, allowing them to act as a kind of Android-powered PC.\n\"Although Microsoft has done this in the past, the performance of the S8 makes it a very compelling experience,\" commented Mr Wood.\n\"But while I'm impressed with the dock from a technology perspective, the practicality of it for consumers is questionable.\"\nI'm not sure I share Samsung's bold declaration that the S8 is \"a work of art\" - but the slimmer handset definitely sits more easily in one hand than its predecessor.\nAnd once you see the surface, which is nearly all-screen, you wonder why you ever needed a physical home button or any other furniture around it.\nThe tech giant has high hopes for its digital assistant Bixby. What I tried was a limited demo model, which only seemed to understand a few predetermined cues such as searching photos and telling you the weather.\nThe idea of using the camera as Bixby's \"eyes\" is neat - but is it enough to draw people away from the more familiar Google Assistant, which will also be preinstalled, as it is on other Android devices?\nI'd like to be able to tell you more about the battery life of what I imagine is a power-hungry little device - but Samsung was coy about that. Batteries are still a sensitive subject.\nSamsung Electronics's stock has shrugged off months of bad news, thanks in part to the popularity of last year's Galaxy S7, strong sales of its OLED screens and other components to rival manufacturers, and the fact that investors hope the firm has learned from its mistakes.\nEven so, the company will hope its latest launch will demonstrate it has turned a corner.\n21 Feb 2016: Galaxy S7 phones unveiled - handsets bring back expandable storage and water resistance\n24 May 2016: Sued by Huawei - Chinese rival claims patent infringement - Samsung later countersues\n8 July 2016: S7 Active fails test - Consumer Reports finds phone fails to survive submerged as advertised\n20 July 2016: S7 Active fix found - Samsung acknowledges and resolves production line fault\n2 Aug 2016: Galaxy Note 7 revealed - Pen-controlled phone gains iris scanner and attracts positive reviews\n24 Aug 2016: First Note 7 \"explosion\" report - News from South Korea of a burnt-out phone\n2 Sept 2016: First Note 7 recall - 2.5 million handsets called back because of battery fault\n1 Oct 2016:  Note 7 returns to sale - Devices return to sale a few days later than planned\n5 Oct 2016: Viv assistant acquired - Tech forms basis for the Bixby helper\n11 Oct 2016: Second Note 7 recall - Action taken after incidents including a fire on a plane\n4 Nov 2016: Washing machine callback - 2.8m machines recalled in US after reports of excessive vibrations\n8 Nov 2016: HQ raided - Seoul office raided as part of corruption probe\n4 Jan 2017: Brighter TVs - QLED-branded TVs, laptops and smart skin sensor unveiled at CES tech expo\n17 Feb 2017: Chief arrested - Vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics, Lee Jae-yong, faces bribery allegations\n27 Feb 2017: Two new tablets - New devices, but Galaxy S8 was not ready for launch at Barcelona's MWC tech expo\n29 March 2017: Galaxy S8 launch - New flagship phones unveiled in New York\n\nSummary:"}

{"id": "7154", "document": "The stage is a 27 metre (88ft) platform fitted to the rock face over Abereiddy's Blue Lagoon with 5,000 people expected to line the cliffs to see divers leap, twist and somersault, with concentration their only form of protection.\nThis is the third time the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series has come to Wales, and along with Ironman Wales, puts Pembrokeshire firmly on the world map.\nAbereiddy is the sixth stop of the series, and eyes were on the reigning champion Gary Hunt, who was representing Great Britain along with Blake Aldridge and wildcard Mat Cowen.\nBut the Czeck Republic's Michal Suprati Navratil took first place, with Hunt second and the United States' Andy Jones third.\nThe competition took place on Saturday but Sunday's events had to be cancelled due to the weather.\nHunt, 32, is originally from Southampton but has lived in Paris, for the past six years.\nHe is a former Commonwealth diver and won bronze in the 10 metre (33ft) synchronisation event at the 2006 games. He also enjoyed success at the Great Britain National Diving championships.\nBut he was not always a diver. As a child he was a competitive club swimmer, but became bored of just going up and down the lanes. At age nine, his attention turned to the excitement of the diving pool.\n\"I had a go and instantly fell in love,\" he told BBC Wales.\nAfter finding it difficult to qualify for World Championships and Olympic diving events, Hunt took the opportunity to join a diving show in Italy. It was here he met Australian diver Steve Black, who saw Hunt's potential and put his name forward for high diving competitions.\n\"The door opened a whole new world for me,\" said Hunt.\nSince his first high diving competition in 2007, Hunt has gone on to win five Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series. He is the only athlete who has competed in all 50 world series stops - and has won half of them.\nBut what does it actually feel like to stand on the 27 metre platform and look down?\n\"We're all terrified when we stand on the platform. It comes with the job,\" said Hunt.\n\"But you build up confidence every time you do it.\"\nAsked what makes the perfect dive, Hunt said: \"To get a 10, you need a strong jump, you need to be the right distance away from the platform, everything in the dive needs to be neat and tidy, your feet need to be together and the finish needs to be perfect, with no splash.\"\n\"It's always a jump into the unknown,\" he added. \"And we all know a small mistake can lead to a trip to the hospital.\"\nThis is something Hunt's fellow British diver Blake Aldridge knows all too well. At the last round in Italy he had a bad landing and ended up biting his tongue.\n\"I had to have both sides stitched up,\" said Aldridge, who spoke to BBC Wales shortly after diving from the walls of Chepstow Castle in Monmouthshire.\n\"I had severe whiplash and am carrying a bad shoulder injury which meant I had to change my dives for the weekend. But it's not in my nature to give up and I was never going to miss my home event,\" he said.\nAldridge, 34, and from London, is a former British diving champion.

Summarize the following news article into one, concise sentence capturing the main point.\n\nArticle:\nThe stage is a 27 metre (88ft) platform fitted to the rock face over Abereiddy's Blue Lagoon with 5,000 people expected to line the cliffs to see divers leap, twist and somersault, with concentration their only form of protection.\nThis is the third time the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series has come to Wales, and along with Ironman Wales, puts Pembrokeshire firmly on the world map.\nAbereiddy is the sixth stop of the series, and eyes were on the reigning champion Gary Hunt, who was representing Great Britain along with Blake Aldridge and wildcard Mat Cowen.\nBut the Czeck Republic's Michal Suprati Navratil took first place, with Hunt second and the United States' Andy Jones third.\nThe competition took place on Saturday but Sunday's events had to be cancelled due to the weather.\nHunt, 32, is originally from Southampton but has lived in Paris, for the past six years.\nHe is a former Commonwealth diver and won bronze in the 10 metre (33ft) synchronisation event at the 2006 games. He also enjoyed success at the Great Britain National Diving championships.\nBut he was not always a diver. As a child he was a competitive club swimmer, but became bored of just going up and down the lanes. At age nine, his attention turned to the excitement of the diving pool.\n\"I had a go and instantly fell in love,\" he told BBC Wales.\nAfter finding it difficult to qualify for World Championships and Olympic diving events, Hunt took the opportunity to join a diving show in Italy. It was here he met Australian diver Steve Black, who saw Hunt's potential and put his name forward for high diving competitions.\n\"The door opened a whole new world for me,\" said Hunt.\nSince his first high diving competition in 2007, Hunt has gone on to win five Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series. He is the only athlete who has competed in all 50 world series stops - and has won half of them.\nBut what does it actually feel like to stand on the 27 metre platform and look down?\n\"We're all terrified when we stand on the platform. It comes with the job,\" said Hunt.\n\"But you build up confidence every time you do it.\"\nAsked what makes the perfect dive, Hunt said: \"To get a 10, you need a strong jump, you need to be the right distance away from the platform, everything in the dive needs to be neat and tidy, your feet need to be together and the finish needs to be perfect, with no splash.\"\n\"It's always a jump into the unknown,\" he added. \"And we all know a small mistake can lead to a trip to the hospital.\"\nThis is something Hunt's fellow British diver Blake Aldridge knows all too well. At the last round in Italy he had a bad landing and ended up biting his tongue.\n\"I had to have both sides stitched up,\" said Aldridge, who spoke to BBC Wales shortly after diving from the walls of Chepstow Castle in Monmouthshire.\n\"I had severe whiplash and am carrying a bad shoulder injury which meant I had to change my dives for the weekend. But it's not in my nature to give up and I was never going to miss my home event,\" he said.\nAldridge, 34, and from London, is a former British diving champion. He was a finalist in the 10m synchronised dive in the 2008 Olympic Games with partner Tom Daley.\nAfter retiring from Olympic diving in 2010 he was invited by Red Bull to take part in high diving.\n\"The first time I stood on the 27 metre platform, I stepped back.

They were wrong about the euro then and they are wrong now.\"\nAnd speaking to BBC Newsnight, Leave campaigner Jacob Rees Mogg suggested that Lord Patten's \"anger is almost certainly synthetic\".\nThe MP suggested Lord Patten was trying to \"bash down\" Mr Johnson because he knows that the former London mayor was \"hugely popular and trusted\" and was making the case for an EU exit \"exceptionally effectively\".\nThe Daily Mail reported earlier this week that \"senior party figures\" had warned of a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron after 23 June, whatever the outcome, over his handling of the referendum campaign.\nOn the question of re-uniting the Conservative Party after the referendum, Lord Patten said that if the UK voted to Leave the EU it would be \"very difficult\" for Mr Cameron to stay on as leader.\n\"Are people like Michael Gove and Mr Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith... are they all going to require Mr Cameron to go cap in hand around Europe for the next few years trying to negotiate new trade deals and new agreements with the EU?\n\"I don't know,\" he said.\nLord Patten said if Britain voted to remain in the EU, Mr Cameron would have to assert his authority and try to bring the party together.\nBut he suggested the PM should give Mr Johnson a challenging cabinet post, such as running the Department for Health.\n\"That will really test whether there is something behind all the jokes,\" he said.\nLord Patten also criticised the wider Vote Leave campaign, saying it's objective appeared to be \"to keep the turnout as low as possible and to tell young people to stay at home and not vote\", which , he said, was \"extraordinary\".\nAnd he added: \"I worry that for a lot of the Brexiteers, in a sort of spittle-flecked way, this is a neverendum, not a referendum.\"\nAlso in the interview, the former Tory party chairman conceded that he had made the wrong call on Britain joining the Euro.\n\"I put my hand up,\" he said. \"Everybody occasionally makes a mistake and I think I was wrong about that.\"\n\nSummary:"}

It's also their name on money,\" she adds.\nSince that day, the treasurer has kept copies of each denomination, including the recently printed new $100 note and the rare $2 bill.\n\"To have people know that a woman is representing our government is a very big milestone that has continued to this day,\" she stresses.\nShe is not the only woman to have a prominent role in the world of finance and politics, which has traditionally been male-dominated.\nFor instance, in February this year, Janet Yellen became the first female chair of the Federal Reserve, while Sylvia Mathews-Burwell, the White House budget director, has just been nominated as US health secretary by President Barack Obama.\n\"Women are playing a very significant role in economic dialogue, not just domestically but globally as well,\" says Ms Gumataotao Rios.\n\"The more we recognise that role women play, the more it will inspire future generations to also think about a career in finance and economics.\"\n\nSummary:"}

She stood in Carlisle at the 2015 election, coming third with 12% of the vote.\n\"Copeland voted 62% to leave the EU,\" she said. \"What better way to send a message to the government that we want a full Brexit as soon as possible than to return a UKIP MP.\"\nRebecca Hanson has been chosen to fight the seat for the Liberal Democrats.\nLabour is due to choose a candidate on 25 January to fight Stoke-on-Trent Central, in a by-election triggered by historian Mr Hunt's appointment as director of the V&A Museum.\nDespite being a traditional Labour safe seat, Mr Corbyn faces an awkward contest in a city which voted overwhelmingly Leave in last year's EU referendum.\nUKIP - which took second place in the 2015 general election - is due to announce its candidate on Saturday, amid widespread expectation that leader Paul Nuttall will fight the seat in the hope of becoming his party's second MP in the Commons.\n\nSummary:"}

There are so many life skills and we can teach our kids from a really young age that anyone can play football.\nWhat are your thoughts on more women being board members at the FA?

It can't be the same people who were there previously.\nThe whole thing needs to change and we need to look at getting more women involved and more ethnic minorities and different age groups.

No. I just think the way we're built and made up, it's like having the fastest woman in the world against the fastest man in the world. The guy is going to win. They should play together and develop at a young age when the physical attributes are pretty much the same.\nIt depends on what you want to see. If you're going to watch a women's game to see high-tempo physical game you're not going to get that. You need to look at it and be open-minded in what the game is. It is still high-speed and physical but at the tempo of the women's game.\nOpinion on future (hopefully) female managers managing male senior football teams? (Aaron Case)\nEach individual will have different aspirations. I think outside influences will make it extremely difficult for a female to manage a male team. We've seen how the media and fans are looking at [Arsenal manager] Arsene Wenger and [former Leicester boss] Claudio Ranieri.\nImagine if that manager was a woman. People still sadly have the perception that it's a men's game and women don't understand football. People who pass the qualifications and get the right badges should be looked at.\nManaging is managing people and managing players, you don't have to be a man to do that. If you've passed those courses you know your stuff anyway.\nChairmen and boards need to be open-minded and if that's the route they want to go down and they find a coach who is the best fit for their club and happens to be a woman, then go for it.

They might cover cars, for example, or perhaps financial services.\nBut there is a problem with this approach:  World Trade Organization rules.\nPerhaps the most fundamental idea behind the WTO's rule book is non-discrimination.\nIt goes by the rather confusing name of \"most favoured nation\".\nIt is Article 1 of the WTO's main legal agreement. It means that you must give the same degree of access to your home market that you give to the most favoured nation to all WTO members. A favour for one should be given to all.\nYou should not discriminate for or against any WTO member.\nThere are a few situations where the rules allow countries to depart from this principle - the one that is relevant here is for free-trade areas and customs unions (the two have important similarities, but are not the same).\nThe WTO's rule book says the member countries \"recognise the desirability of increasing freedom of trade by the development, through voluntary agreements, of closer integration between the economies of countries parties to such agreements\".\nSo a trade agreement between the UK and the EU would be allowed under WTO rules, in fact welcomed, even though it is something that is intrinsically discriminatory. It would involve the EU and the UK discriminating in favour of each other against outside countries.\nOf course, the EU itself has the same effect, offering EU members better access to each other's markets than is available to either China or the United States, for example.\nBut there is a catch. The WTO rules say such agreements should cover \"substantially all the trade\" between the members of the customs union or free-trade area.\nWhat does \"substantially all\" mean? There is some case law which touched on this. A dispute between Turkey (which has a customs union agreement with the EU) and India went to the WTO's appeals body, which said in its report: \"It is clear, though, that 'substantially all the trade' is not the same as all the trade, and also that 'substantially all the trade' is something considerably more than merely some of the trade.\"\nNot as cut and dried as you might hope, but all the trade experts I have spoken to say that a deal covering just a few sectors wouldn't qualify.\nThat seems to be reinforced by what a WTO dispute panel said in another case. This one, as it happens was about cars, an agreement between the US and Canada in the 1960s known as the Auto Pact.\nThere is one line in the panel's ruling that is particularly relevant here: \"The Auto Pact, nevertheless, is a purely sectoral agreement which does not meet the requirements of Article XXIV:8\" - that is the provision that sets out the \"substantially all the trade\" requirement.\nSo such a narrow sectoral deal might well be vulnerable to challenge in the WTO.\nBut would it actually happen?\nThere seems to be a great deal of reluctance to challenge these agreements. (The India v Turkey and Auto Pact disputes were not fundamentally about the wider trade agreements, but about very specific restrictions that the complaining country thought were against the rules.)\nMore than 600 of them have been notified to the WTO or its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\nMany are thought to stretch the credibility of \"substantially all trade\", by having various sectors uncovered.\nBut that makes countries reluctant to challenge others, for fear of shining an unwelcome light on their own agreements. As one senior trade official put it to me: \"It's a glass houses kind of thing.\"\nSo a sectoral agreement between the UK and the EU might be challenged, but it would depend on whether any country wanted to do so.\nThink of cars.  There is another factor that might make a challenge less likely. Japan and the United States have car industries that have a presence in Europe and might well benefit from a deal between the EU and UK.\nSo perhaps we might get away with a narrow trade agreement. Even so, the uncertainty would be unwelcome to the industry concerned.\nThere is also the possibility of simply ignoring any unwelcome WTO ruling. The WTO has no real powers of enforcement.

They cannot stay with one 'keeper, even if we have to play against them, it's not sporting.\"\nTunisia defender Syam Ben Youssef believes the playing surface in Libreville - one of four pitches being used in Gabon - is so bad that his side will have to change their style when they face Zimbabwe there for their final Group B match.\nSo far the Carthage Eagles have played both their matches in Franceville, which is seen as the best of the four pitches.\n\"Of course (it will affect us) I think we have technical players we like to play,\" Ben Youssef said.\n\"But it's usual for us to play in Africa on bad pitches so we have to win and not care about the pitch.\"\nBurkina Faso midfielder Adama Guira is also unhappy with the state of the pitches - but resigned to it at the same time.\nAfter the Stallions' 1-1 draw with hosts Gabon in Libreville on Wednesday, he warned that players need to be careful in the conditions.\n\"To be honest it is very hard to play on that kind of a field because you can't control your running and stopping so it's difficult,\" he said.\n\"But we are in Africa and we are Africans so we'll do our best for our country.\"\nPitches are just about thinking and having the money - Caf must think about it\nIt is not just the pitch at the Stade de l'Amitie in Libreville that has been criticised. Mali's Bakary Sako was less than impressed with the surface in Port-Gentil after his side's goalless draw with Egypt.\n\"The pitch is horrendous it's really tough to control the ball, to drive with the ball, everything is tough,\" said the midfielder who plays his club football for Crystal Palace.\n\"You have to be focussed 100% but it is the same for both teams so we have to get on with it.\"\nIt is a problem that is not confined to the Nations Cup according to Grant, who revealed he was taken aback by the pitches when he first arrived in Africa as Ghana coach in November 2014.\n\"Africa has great champions but you can't play on these pitches,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"I think when I came to Africa the first thing I was very very surprised about - and not in a good way - was the quality of the pitches.\n\"That's why I admire the local league and the local players - they are paid $100 a month, sometimes they aren't even paid, and the pitches are not so good.\n\"Eighty-two per cent of the injuries are ankle injuries and they are giving everything. You see the passion, I admire them really. The next target should be good pitches.\"\nFormer Cameroon international goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell believes the continent's governing body, the Confederation of African Football (Caf), must address the issue.\n\"If the game is not attractive because of the pitch it means something,\" he told the BBC's World Football programme.\n\"Pitches are just about thinking and having the money - Caf must think about it.\n\"Africa likes to be told 'oh you have tried', but its not about doing your best it's about being the best.\"\nHowever, it does not appear as though Caf is going to take any action soon, judging by comments made by Khalilou Fadiga, a former Senegal international now on Caf's technical and development committee.\n\"Let the players not expect the pitches in Africa to be like those in Europe,\" Fadiga said on Friday.\n\nSummary:"}

{"id": "4326", "document": "When he saw the exit poll on election night, 2015, on the first bong of Big Ben, he began to celebrate the first majority Conservative government for 23 years. But the successful decapitation of his coalition partners turned out to be a curse.\nWithout a majority, it would have been easier to postpone the EU referendum that brought him down, and blame the delay on those pesky Liberal Democrats. That chance was lost.\nInstead, with the bravado that he sometimes enjoys to indulge, he pressed on. And another piece of luck turned against him. He watched the Labour Party elect Jeremy Corbyn to succeed Ed Miliband. Still unaware of how much that meant, he prepared for life after the referendum and the delicious chance to reshape his government for an extended swansong.\nBut Corbyn's lukewarm referendum campaign - and his unpopularity among many older Labour voters who pulsed to the Brexit message - compounded the consequences of Cameron's decision to go for a vote. And there was no way back.\nHe now finds himself in the unusual position of depending on his referendum arguments being proved wrong for his reputation to rise.\nIf recession is avoided, and Brexit seems calmer than the Cameron-Osborne stormy forecast - complete with thunder, lightning and financial pestilence - then he may be seen as a significant transitional figure who left the country strong enough to adapt to fundamental constitutional change.\nIf not, he will surely be considered - at least in the years immediately ahead - a prime minister whose rashness betrayed him, and as a leader too weak to unite a party still riven by the schism at the end of the Thatcher era that remains an obvious and debilitating rift, albeit a touch less ill-mannered than Labour's.\nThe Cameron project delivered some of the \"progressive\" reforms that he promised - he would cite gay marriage and the national living wage - but never stood a chance of healing a party in which many of the members didn't want those reforms.\nTherefore his legacy will depend in large part on the performance of his successor. If she finds a way of negotiating a way through the Brussels thicket that can satisfy most reasonable Leave campaigners and reassure others that 40 years hasn't been thrown away for nothing, Cameron will be one of the beneficiaries.\nBut think of the dangers. A governing party split more painfully even than before. Financial storms stirred up by markets and businesses who don't believe the negotiation offers prosperity, and take their investment elsewhere.\nPerhaps even - although there's been too much loose talk of this - an independence referendum in Scotland in two years or so, and the possibility of a Yes vote.\nIn those circumstances Cameron would slip fast down the prime ministerial league table.\nHe might find himself near the bottom of the modern ones, bumping into Anthony Eden, after whose downfall an American secretary of state said famously that Britain had lost an empire and not yet found a role.\nThe pervasive feeling of failure that followed Suez - much greater than the scale of the fiasco itself - could easily return.\nCameron needs a successful Brexit to prove himself wrong and - with a feeling of paradox that he will enjoy - rehabilitate his brief and explosive second term.\nBehind the polished good humour of his last prime minister's question time, that is the irony that clings to him as he leaves Downing Street - his cabinet, all his powers of patronage, and his cat. He is a young man, with a career ahead of him, and he will understand well how important it is for him that the political barometer turns to \"fair\" in Theresa May's first year or two.\nHe will look, too, with mixed feelings at the Labour Party.

Summarize the following news article into one, concise sentence capturing the main point.\n\nArticle:\nWhen he saw the exit poll on election night, 2015, on the first bong of Big Ben, he began to celebrate the first majority Conservative government for 23 years. But the successful decapitation of his coalition partners turned out to be a curse.\nWithout a majority, it would have been easier to postpone the EU referendum that brought him down, and blame the delay on those pesky Liberal Democrats. That chance was lost.\nInstead, with the bravado that he sometimes enjoys to indulge, he pressed on. And another piece of luck turned against him. He watched the Labour Party elect Jeremy Corbyn to succeed Ed Miliband. Still unaware of how much that meant, he prepared for life after the referendum and the delicious chance to reshape his government for an extended swansong.\nBut Corbyn's lukewarm referendum campaign - and his unpopularity among many older Labour voters who pulsed to the Brexit message - compounded the consequences of Cameron's decision to go for a vote. And there was no way back.\nHe now finds himself in the unusual position of depending on his referendum arguments being proved wrong for his reputation to rise.\nIf recession is avoided, and Brexit seems calmer than the Cameron-Osborne stormy forecast - complete with thunder, lightning and financial pestilence - then he may be seen as a significant transitional figure who left the country strong enough to adapt to fundamental constitutional change.\nIf not, he will surely be considered - at least in the years immediately ahead - a prime minister whose rashness betrayed him, and as a leader too weak to unite a party still riven by the schism at the end of the Thatcher era that remains an obvious and debilitating rift, albeit a touch less ill-mannered than Labour's.\nThe Cameron project delivered some of the \"progressive\" reforms that he promised - he would cite gay marriage and the national living wage - but never stood a chance of healing a party in which many of the members didn't want those reforms.\nTherefore his legacy will depend in large part on the performance of his successor. If she finds a way of negotiating a way through the Brussels thicket that can satisfy most reasonable Leave campaigners and reassure others that 40 years hasn't been thrown away for nothing, Cameron will be one of the beneficiaries.\nBut think of the dangers. A governing party split more painfully even than before. Financial storms stirred up by markets and businesses who don't believe the negotiation offers prosperity, and take their investment elsewhere.\nPerhaps even - although there's been too much loose talk of this - an independence referendum in Scotland in two years or so, and the possibility of a Yes vote.\nIn those circumstances Cameron would slip fast down the prime ministerial league table.\nHe might find himself near the bottom of the modern ones, bumping into Anthony Eden, after whose downfall an American secretary of state said famously that Britain had lost an empire and not yet found a role.\nThe pervasive feeling of failure that followed Suez - much greater than the scale of the fiasco itself - could easily return.\nCameron needs a successful Brexit to prove himself wrong and - with a feeling of paradox that he will enjoy - rehabilitate his brief and explosive second term.\nBehind the polished good humour of his last prime minister's question time, that is the irony that clings to him as he leaves Downing Street - his cabinet, all his powers of patronage, and his cat. He is a young man, with a career ahead of him, and he will understand well how important it is for him that the political barometer turns to \"fair\" in Theresa May's first year or two.\nHe will look, too, with mixed feelings at the Labour Party. Having been hobbled by Corbyn's unenthusiastic Euro-campaign, Cameron will now enjoy the sight of the official opposition tearing itself to pieces in a leadership election and what will certainly be a bitter aftermath, whoever wins.\nAnd he might wonder whether, deep in the uncertainty that will accompany that process, there lies a coming political realignment that will intrigue and puzzle the centre-left for a long time to come.

{"id": "5787", "document": "The Independent Schools Council (ISC) says if the government pays £5,550 per place - the cost in the state system - the schools will cover the rest.

Nothing seems to faze him,\" said captain Alastair Cook.\nHameed, who scored 1,129 runs at an average of 52 in County Championship Division One this summer, was called up for the Test tour of Bangladesh in October but did not play in the 1-1 series draw.\nAll-rounder Ben Hollioake, who was 19 when he played against Australia in 1997, is the only other teenager to appear in a Test for England since 18-year-old Brian Close made his debut in 1949.\nLeft-hander Ballance, 26, has been dropped after scoring only 24 runs in four innings in Bangladesh.\n\"I feel sorry for Gary,\" said Cook. \"They were tough conditions in Bangladesh and ultimately it's about how many runs you score.\n\"I still think he's a fine player and one who I think will play again for England and do well.\"\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) threatened to cancel the opening Test - the first to be held in Rajkot - unless judges ended a freeze on its bank accounts.\nLast month, the supreme court ruled that the board must obtain prior approval from a special panel investigating its governance in order to release funds to state associations which host Tests.\nHowever, the supreme court has released £70,000 so the match can go ahead.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nCook, 31, will break Michael Atherton's record of 54 Tests as England captain during the opening game of the five-match series.\nHe hinted in a recent interview with the Cricketer magazine that this series could be his last as captain, but said on Tuesday he was not thinking of anything beyond the India tour.\n\"I have always said to (England director of cricket) Andrew Strauss we will take every series as it comes,\" said Cook.\n\"It could be two months, it could be a year, it could be six months, it could be anything. For me, it's about concentrating on this series.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan said Cook could step down after the series in India, or after the Ashes tour of Australia in 2017-18.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show, he said: \"These next six or seven weeks are not crucial for Cook.\n\"He is breaking records and he has four or five years left as a batsman, if his mind wants to play that long.\n\"I do get the sense that he will get to the stage, whether it's the end of India or the Ashes in a year's time, where he will say, 'I like the idea of standing at first slip and batting for a few more years.'\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEngland seamer Stuart Broad will play his 100th Test in Rajkot, becoming only the 14th England player to do so.\n\"To play 100 Test matches in any position is a great achievement,\" said Cook.\n\"To do it as a seamer in particular is probably a better achievement than a batter because of the physical demands.\"\nFind out how to get into cricket with our inclusive guide.\nBroad, 30, has claimed 360 Test wickets at an average of 28 since making his debut in 2007.\nOnly team-mate James Anderson, who will miss the first Test as he continues his recovery from a shoulder injury, and Sir Ian Botham have taken more for England.\n\"He's turned himself into a fine, fine bowler, one of England's great cricketers,\" said Cook.\n\"I've been very privileged to play with some great cricketers for England and he's certainly right up there.\"\nIndia captain Virat Kohli boasts a career Test average of 45, but only 20 in nine matches against England.\nHe managed only 134 runs in 10 innings on India's 2014 tour of England, after which he has averaged almost 55.\n\"I can put it very simply as that was the phase when I didn't perform too well. It happened to be England and could have been any other country in the world,\" said the 28-year-old.\n\"It made me realise what I need to improve in my game so I am pretty thankful to England for that.

It's basically Bacon and beyond.\"\nHirst, who owns five paintings by the late Francis Bacon, added: \"He didn't make many and he's not making any more.\"\nThe gallery - designed by architects Caruso St John - will take up the whole of Newport Street and incorporates the conversion of a terrace of three listed buildings flanked by two new buildings.\nHirst's gallery follows in the footsteps of London's Saatchi Gallery, opened in 1985 by art collector Charles Saatchi to display his own collection to the public.\nSaatchi also sponsored Hirst, who first came to the public's attention with his 1988 Freeze exhibition of his own works and those of his fellow Goldsmiths College students.\nBBC Arts editor Will Gompertz said Hirst's work as a curator and champion of new art that started with Freeze - from behind-the-scenes support of unknown artists through to collecting and exhibiting - was often overlooked.\n\"Charles Saatchi didn't make Damien Hirst, Damien Hirst made Charles Saatchi,\" he said.\nHirst has previously said that collecting \"is the way the world works, as a human being.\n\"As you go through life, you just collect… I always think collections are like a map of a man's life.\"\nTate Modern's Hirst retrospective will run from 4 April to 9 September and one of Hirst's most famous pieces -the £50m diamond-encrusted skull entitled For the Love of God, will be on display in the gallery's Turbine Hall from 4 April to 24 June.\n\nSummary:"}

There appeared to be little danger of buyers slipping down to where they started.\nThen the financial crisis hit, the board became a seething mass of snakes, and the property market did not seem as easy to play after all.\nSo, how has the game changed now, and what is facing those who fell back to having to start all over again?\nWith an interest-only mortgage, householders pay off the interest on the loan but not the capital. At the end of the mortgage term, borrowers are expected to repay the capital.\nThe attraction of interest-only mortgages was obvious to many young first-time buyers. Many were aged in their early 20s, had just started their first job, and were happy to put off any real consideration of how they would pay the loan back, or to rely solely on the rising value of their home.\nIn addition, they were cheaper than the repayment option.\nBut, as they became more and more popular, this type of mortgage was placed more frequently under the microscope of the City regulator - the Financial Services Authority (FSA).\nIn 2006, when 24% of all new mortgages were lent on an interest-only basis, the FSA said most people with interest-only mortgages did not have \"robust plans\" to repay them\n\"There is nothing wrong with interest-only mortgages,\" said Clive Briault, of the FSA, six years ago. \"However, consumers must be very clear about how they are going to repay the loans they take out.\"\nThat comment may sound familiar because just a few weeks ago, Martin Wheatley, the managing director of the FSA said almost exactly the same thing.\n\"There is a place for interest-only,\" he told a mortgage industry conference. \"Lenders must ensure these mortgages are taken out by consumers with a concrete repayment plan.\"\nThe fears may not have changed, but the market for interest-only mortgages certainly has.\nIn the last week or so, RBS, NatWest and the Coventry Building Society have pulled out of the market altogether. They followed a withdrawal in October by the UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide.\n\"Whether this is the ultimate final nail in the coffin remains to be seen, but it does look increasingly like interest only is destined to survive only as a niche product or the preserve of the wealthy through the private banking fraternity,\" said Andrew Montlake, director at mortgage broker Coreco.\nThe only lender to ease its stance is Santander which, after cutting back sharply on interest-only, is now allowing a mix of interest-only and repayment under a new deal.\nThe FSA would be pleased to see interest-only disappearing for good as a mainstream product, but that is not a view shared by everyone.\nSource: Moody's Investors Service\nJonathan Harris, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, said: \"Interest-only is increasingly becoming a niche product, the preserve of wealthier borrowers. It is a shame as you don't necessarily have to be wealthy to have a viable repayment strategy for an interest-only loan.\"\nThat refers to people like Malcolm King. He took out an interest-only mortgage more than 25 years ago, says he has never missed a payment, and has always had a plan to pay off the capital - based on investments and the success of his business.\n\"I made a decision and take total responsibility for it,\" he says. \"Most people went into this with their eyes open.\"\nHe says that, as he is now aged 61, he had to \"grovel\" to his lender to be allowed to continue borrowing on the same terms, even though he had a successful business and a solid repayment plan.\nIt is likely that Mr King, who lives in Cobham in Surrey, will not be the only homeowner in his part of the world facing the need to grovel to a lender.\nA recent report by Moody's Investors Service suggests that more than half of all outstanding mortgages are interest only in the south of England, compared with a third in the north of England.\n\"Less creditworthy borrowers [are] at risk of being unable to refinance onto new rates,\" the report said.\nThis means they face being locked into a mortgage, and have no choice but pay higher rates when their current deal expires.\nUnder FSA regulations, which will come into force in April 2014, lenders will have to put this repayment plan under greater scrutiny with a full affordability assessment.\nTo help these mortgage prisoners, the FSA has suggested that a new or existing lender can waive the rules for borrowers, who demonstrate a good payment history and do not want to increase the loan, to be able to shift onto a new deal.\nIn contrast, first-time buyers will be given the third degree.\nThe effect of this, according to estate agents, is that most are seeking the financial help of family and friends, and ensure they have their mortgage agreed before they even start searching for a home.\nBeckenham in Kent is a prime spot for such buyers. Good schools and convenient links to London mean it is popular with young families and professionals.\nBut, according to Robert Dabrowski, of estate agent Langford Russell, the interest-only mortgage is a \"dead market\" to those first-time buyers they see.\nAs a result, he says that first-time buyers have got older recently, and he is seeing more people buying as couples rather than on their own.\nWarren Pinner, sales director at neighbouring Curran and Pinner, says that first-time buyers with their finance already organised can make life a lot easier for estate agents.\nHowever, he predicts a steady return among some mortgage providers of home loans with an interest-only element. This is not a view not shared by everyone, and would certainly not mean a wholesale return of solely interest-only mortgages.\nThis may place more snakes on the property board, but they should be easier to avoid for those seeking to climb onto the nearest ladder.", "reference": "In the game of snakes and property ladders, winning now looks a lot more difficult for young buyers.", "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

They followed a withdrawal in October by the UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide.\n\"Whether this is the ultimate final nail in the coffin remains to be seen, but it does look increasingly like interest only is destined to survive only as a niche product or the preserve of the wealthy through the private banking fraternity,\" said Andrew Montlake, director at mortgage broker Coreco.\nThe only lender to ease its stance is Santander which, after cutting back sharply on interest-only, is now allowing a mix of interest-only and repayment under a new deal.\nThe FSA would be pleased to see interest-only disappearing for good as a mainstream product, but that is not a view shared by everyone.\nSource: Moody's Investors Service\nJonathan Harris, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, said: \"Interest-only is increasingly becoming a niche product, the preserve of wealthier borrowers. It is a shame as you don't necessarily have to be wealthy to have a viable repayment strategy for an interest-only loan.\"\nThat refers to people like Malcolm King. He took out an interest-only mortgage more than 25 years ago, says he has never missed a payment, and has always had a plan to pay off the capital - based on investments and the success of his business.\n\"I made a decision and take total responsibility for it,\" he says. \"Most people went into this with their eyes open.\"\nHe says that, as he is now aged 61, he had to \"grovel\" to his lender to be allowed to continue borrowing on the same terms, even though he had a successful business and a solid repayment plan.\nIt is likely that Mr King, who lives in Cobham in Surrey, will not be the only homeowner in his part of the world facing the need to grovel to a lender.\nA recent report by Moody's Investors Service suggests that more than half of all outstanding mortgages are interest only in the south of England, compared with a third in the north of England.\n\"Less creditworthy borrowers [are] at risk of being unable to refinance onto new rates,\" the report said.\nThis means they face being locked into a mortgage, and have no choice but pay higher rates when their current deal expires.\nUnder FSA regulations, which will come into force in April 2014, lenders will have to put this repayment plan under greater scrutiny with a full affordability assessment.\nTo help these mortgage prisoners, the FSA has suggested that a new or existing lender can waive the rules for borrowers, who demonstrate a good payment history and do not want to increase the loan, to be able to shift onto a new deal.\nIn contrast, first-time buyers will be given the third degree.\nThe effect of this, according to estate agents, is that most are seeking the financial help of family and friends, and ensure they have their mortgage agreed before they even start searching for a home.\nBeckenham in Kent is a prime spot for such buyers. Good schools and convenient links to London mean it is popular with young families and professionals.\nBut, according to Robert Dabrowski, of estate agent Langford Russell, the interest-only mortgage is a \"dead market\" to those first-time buyers they see.\nAs a result, he says that first-time buyers have got older recently, and he is seeing more people buying as couples rather than on their own.\nWarren Pinner, sales director at neighbouring Curran and Pinner, says that first-time buyers with their finance already organised can make life a lot easier for estate agents.\nHowever, he predicts a steady return among some mortgage providers of home loans with an interest-only element. This is not a view not shared by everyone, and would certainly not mean a wholesale return of solely interest-only mortgages.\nThis may place more snakes on the property board, but they should be easier to avoid for those seeking to climb onto the nearest ladder.\n\nSummary:"}
