{"id": "eval-2458", "document": "So what is the levy? What's really at stake? And why raise the rate now?\nWhat is the bank levy?\nIt is an annual tax on the value of all of the debts of the UK banks (including money deposited with the banks), except that:\nOriginally, the Treasury had planned to charge a lower rate of 0.05% during 2011, but in February it changed its mind, and switched to the standard rate of 0.075% from May.\nThe standard rate was originally set at 0.075%, but it was raised slightly in March to 0.078%, and is now being raised again, to 0.088%, from January.\nWhat's it for?\nThe government thinks it will discourage banks from relying on risky forms of borrowing, which were blamed for making the 2008 crisis much more dangerous.\nThe tax will also raise a lot of money for the government.\nSo will this help deal with the budget deficit?\nThe Treasury hopes the tax will bring in £2.6bn every year.\nThat's equivalent to 2.1% of the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast for the budget deficit this year.\nIt's no small amount for the banks either. It's equivalent to about 19% of the reported profits before tax of the big five UK banks over the 12 months to September this year - although the tax burden will be borne by more than just these five.\nWhat's risky about the type of borrowing that the government wants to discourage?\nTraditionally, most of the money that banks lend out comes from the deposits they receive from ordinary people and companies.\nBut during the past decade, banks found new and more complex ways to borrow trillions of pounds from international markets.\nUnlike ordinary deposits, there is no natural limit on the availability of this money, as it can come from anywhere in the globe, and the same money can be recycled between the banks again and again.\nA lot of the debts created were very short-term - meaning the banks needed to go back to the markets to reborrow every few days.\nWhen the financial crisis hit, investors began to worry that banks might not be able to repay their debts.\nThis caused a kind of bank run, with investors refusing to lend.\nUnable to refinance all of their short-term debts, even profitable banks were threatened with failure.\nWhy are retail deposits exempt from the levy?\nBank runs are popularly associated with long queues of ordinary depositors wanting to empty their bank accounts - just as happened to Northern Rock.\nBut since the 1930s, governments have insured most of the money deposited by their citizens in order to discourage these depositor bank runs. Indeed, the government responded to the Northern Rock crisis by promising to guarantee all of its deposits.\nIn the UK, the first £85,000 of an individual's money is insured (it used to be £35,000 before the financial crisis).\nThis means that most depositors do not need to worry about the safety of their money during a financial crisis, and the banks don't need to worry about all those deposits being withdrawn.\nSo why not just insure all the banks' borrowings?\nThe bank levy was actually first proposed to all countries by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a type of insurance scheme.\nThe IMF said the money raised should be channelled into a special fund that could be used to pay for the cost of cleaning up future banking crises.\nHowever, the UK government took the view that these borrowings are inherently risky, and wanted to discourage them altogether by taxing them.\nIf the debts were insured, lenders would see them as less risky, making them a cheaper and easier way for banks to borrow.\nThe government's fear is that the banks would then just continue taking on more and more debt, until they became impossibly large to rescue - as proved the case in the Republic of Ireland or Iceland.\nIndeed, the total debts of the UK's banks had already reached a staggering 4.5 times the size of the entire UK economy before the crisis.\nSome might also point out another reason why the government chose not to go for an insurance scheme.\nBy making it a tax instead, the revenue raised can be channelled straight to the Treasury, helping to pay for the government's own spending.\nWhy is the first £20bn of debts exempt from the tax?\nThe government wants to encourage banks to shrink.\nThe thinking is that the collapse of a big bank could threaten the stability of the entire financial system, whereas the failure of a small bank should not.\nThe £20bn figure is about the size of the Coventry Building Society. So it means banks will only pay the tax to the extent they are bigger than that.\nWhy is the tax rate lower on long-term debts?\nLonger-term debts are inherently less risky.\nFinancial crises - at least the most intense part of them - tend to be over in a matter of a few weeks or months.\nIf a bank does not have to repay its debts for more than a year, then it can probably ride out the crisis.\nWill the levy really discourage banks?\nThe tax will increase the cost of \"risky\" short-term borrowing for banks by just under one-tenth of a percentage point.\nThis may seem small, but it will eat into the banks' precious margins - the difference between the interest they pay on their deposits and what they earn on their lending - which is their main source of income.\nHowever, the banks may pass some of the tax cost on to their savers (via a lower deposit rate) or their borrowers (via a higher lending rate).\nBut to get the 0.088% in context, the Bank of England slashed short-term borrowing costs by 5.2 percentage points in response to the financial crisis.\nWhy did the government want to phase the levy in?\nThe original plan was to charge 0.05% for 2011, before going up to the full 0.075% rate next year (increased to 0.078% in March).\nThe government didn't want to raise the banks' borrowing costs at a time when their financial stability was still in question.\nThey also did not want to sap the banks' profits too quickly.\nThe banks might need to use all the profits they could get to rebuild their capital - their buffer against future losses - in order to meet tough new international standards being set by the Basel committee of banking regulators.\nSo why did the government change its mind?\nIn February, the Treasury said it wanted to charge the full £2.6bn this year after all.\nIt pointed to the Bank of England's latest Financial Stability Report, which painted a much rosier picture of the UK's banks.\nMoreover, the new Basel rules on bank capital won't take full effect until 2019, giving banks a full eight years to meet the higher standards.\nIt probably also helped that the banks have been reporting much better profits than many would have expected a year ago.\nAnd markets seemed less and less concerned about the risk of lending to banks - at least until the eurozone debt crisis flared up since the summer of 2011.\nWhy is the government raising the rate again?\nThe chancellor raised the rate to 0.088% in his Autumn Statement.\nAccording to the Treasury, the tax was not on course to raise the £2.6bn originally planned for this year.\nThe Treasury said that it had simply overestimated how much borrowing is done by foreign banks in the UK - and is therefore subject to the tax.\nIt could also be that banks have been reducing their borrowing.

It is due to be cut again soon.\nRefugees can't get work permits so can't earn money for the papers they need to renew every year - the $200 (Â£130) is out of sight for most of them.\nAlmost unbelievably, they have to pay rent for their camps, and they are not allowed to expand them, even though the population is steadily growing.\nThe borders are closed, so they can't go back and relatives can't join them.\nThe schoolroom is funded with aid from Britain.\nIt is part of the UK government's case that while it make take fewer refugees than other countries, it spends far more in helping people in the Middle East.\nBut it is noticeable that the schoolroom is decorated with crayon drawings in black, yellow and red - the German flag.\n\"Next time you come, we have a British flag,\" says Mr al-Ali, slightly embarrassed.\nHe says he wants German Chancellor Angela Merkel to send a big ship to take them all to Europe.\nThere is anger here that the rich Gulf States and Saudi Arabia have done next to nothing to help settle refugees and seem oblivious to the fact that some might think it their responsibility before Europe's.\nFor this crisis raises some interesting questions about leadership.\nGermany's latest intervention is fascinating, reflecting a change in attitude that means it is more confident of making foreign policy gestures intended to show leadership in Europe, and which demonstrate a wish to change the world through instruments other than war.\nThere is also a new impatience with other EU members, and a willingness to lead through example rather than wait for agreement.\nGermany, where for a long time foreign workers have been made to feel unloved, wants to show itself as open to the world, a successful and dynamic economy that can absorb, indeed needs, a new workforce.\nBut it may have unintended consequences.\nEarlier this week, Lebanon's morning newspaper, the Daily Star, carried an advert by the Danish government, warning it had toughened up its asylum rules and cut benefits to migrants.\nThe Danes will not be the only ones who worry about the downside of German generosity.\nPeople I met in Lebanon say those who would like to leave Iraq and Afghanistan have heard a message - now is the time to go to Europe, before there is another change of mood and the drawbridge goes up again.\nSo it is little wonder people in non-governmental organisations (NGOs) feel Mr Cameron may be onto something - it makes sense processing people here, rather than luring them into a dangerous journey.\nBut while the British policy was announced last week and fleshed out in the Commons on Monday, no-one in Lebanon has heard anything officially.\nThe generous feel it will take a while, the cynical that it is all about the headlines.\nWednesday's announcement on migrant quotas was focused solely on dealing with the crisis within Europe, but there has not even been a whisper of a coordinated European approach using camps in the Middle East, which is what would seem to make the most sense.\nIt is the death of one toddler on a Turkish shore and the sight of thousands of people dragging themselves across Europe that has focused the minds of politicians on this crisis on our continent.\nThere is  a clear need, somehow, to absorb - or, some might argue, return - these people.\nBut the far greater crisis is elsewhere, and indeed is also in the future.\nMass migration is not just the by-product of one horrible war, or even several conflicts and vile regimes but, in part, the result of the growing aspirations, understanding and opportunity that globalisation brings.\nBiafra did not send thousands of the dispossessed into Europe.\nOn 30 May 1967, the head of the Eastern Region of Nigeria, Col Emeka Ojukwu, unilaterally declared the independent Republic of Biafra.\nThe Biafran forces were pushed back after initial military gains.\nMore than two years later, after one million civilians had died in fighting and from famine, Biafra was reabsorbed into Nigeria.\nThirty years ago, the Ethiopian famine produced Live Aid - it meant thousands of people packing into a concert venue in central London for a day, not thousands of the displaced crowding on to trains and lorries for years.\nWhen the cities and farmlands of millions people disappear under the waves, it will not be so.\nWhen nations fight wars over precious water, populations will march, not in protest, but to happier lands.\nIt is genuinely hard for politicians in democracies to think beyond four-year cycles, and the next day's headlines.\nBut perhaps it is time they made a start.\nYou can listen to our programme from Beirut here.", "reference": "The little children trailing round behind us rush forward in their excitement, herding me into their makeshift schoolroom.", "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

It is due to be cut again soon.\nRefugees can't get work permits so can't earn money for the papers they need to renew every year - the $200 (Â£130) is out of sight for most of them.\nAlmost unbelievably, they have to pay rent for their camps, and they are not allowed to expand them, even though the population is steadily growing.\nThe borders are closed, so they can't go back and relatives can't join them.\nThe schoolroom is funded with aid from Britain.\nIt is part of the UK government's case that while it make take fewer refugees than other countries, it spends far more in helping people in the Middle East.\nBut it is noticeable that the schoolroom is decorated with crayon drawings in black, yellow and red - the German flag.\n\"Next time you come, we have a British flag,\" says Mr al-Ali, slightly embarrassed.\nHe says he wants German Chancellor Angela Merkel to send a big ship to take them all to Europe.\nThere is anger here that the rich Gulf States and Saudi Arabia have done next to nothing to help settle refugees and seem oblivious to the fact that some might think it their responsibility before Europe's.\nFor this crisis raises some interesting questions about leadership.\nGermany's latest intervention is fascinating, reflecting a change in attitude that means it is more confident of making foreign policy gestures intended to show leadership in Europe, and which demonstrate a wish to change the world through instruments other than war.\nThere is also a new impatience with other EU members, and a willingness to lead through example rather than wait for agreement.\nGermany, where for a long time foreign workers have been made to feel unloved, wants to show itself as open to the world, a successful and dynamic economy that can absorb, indeed needs, a new workforce.\nBut it may have unintended consequences.\nEarlier this week, Lebanon's morning newspaper, the Daily Star, carried an advert by the Danish government, warning it had toughened up its asylum rules and cut benefits to migrants.\nThe Danes will not be the only ones who worry about the downside of German generosity.\nPeople I met in Lebanon say those who would like to leave Iraq and Afghanistan have heard a message - now is the time to go to Europe, before there is another change of mood and the drawbridge goes up again.\nSo it is little wonder people in non-governmental organisations (NGOs) feel Mr Cameron may be onto something - it makes sense processing people here, rather than luring them into a dangerous journey.\nBut while the British policy was announced last week and fleshed out in the Commons on Monday, no-one in Lebanon has heard anything officially.\nThe generous feel it will take a while, the cynical that it is all about the headlines.\nWednesday's announcement on migrant quotas was focused solely on dealing with the crisis within Europe, but there has not even been a whisper of a coordinated European approach using camps in the Middle East, which is what would seem to make the most sense.\nIt is the death of one toddler on a Turkish shore and the sight of thousands of people dragging themselves across Europe that has focused the minds of politicians on this crisis on our continent.\nThere is  a clear need, somehow, to absorb - or, some might argue, return - these people.\nBut the far greater crisis is elsewhere, and indeed is also in the future.\nMass migration is not just the by-product of one horrible war, or even several conflicts and vile regimes but, in part, the result of the growing aspirations, understanding and opportunity that globalisation brings.\nBiafra did not send thousands of the dispossessed into Europe.\nOn 30 May 1967, the head of the Eastern Region of Nigeria, Col Emeka Ojukwu, unilaterally declared the independent Republic of Biafra.\nThe Biafran forces were pushed back after initial military gains.\nMore than two years later, after one million civilians had died in fighting and from famine, Biafra was reabsorbed into Nigeria.\nThirty years ago, the Ethiopian famine produced Live Aid - it meant thousands of people packing into a concert venue in central London for a day, not thousands of the displaced crowding on to trains and lorries for years.\nWhen the cities and farmlands of millions people disappear under the waves, it will not be so.\nWhen nations fight wars over precious water, populations will march, not in protest, but to happier lands.\nIt is genuinely hard for politicians in democracies to think beyond four-year cycles, and the next day's headlines.\nBut perhaps it is time they made a start.\nYou can listen to our programme from Beirut here.\n\nSummary:"}

Entrance to the exhibit costs Â£12.\n\nSummary:"}

On the ground floor, young men lounge awkwardly in hard-backed chairs, waiting for their turn on the computers lined up on one side of the room. Those in front of the machines don headsets and hold ebullient Skype conversations.\nUpstairs, the atmosphere is completely different. Bewildered-looking families gather in a stuffy \"safe space\" operated by Save The Children. Parents usher their children over to a pile of toys, while a small boy cries inconsolably. The distinctive aroma of the refugee trail - damp, unwashed clothes - begins to fill the room.\n\"They are Yazidi people from Iraq,\" says Marjan, a translator struggling to find a common language with the new arrivals.\nThere are more than two dozen people in this extended family group. They did not follow the classic route to Serbia via Greece and Macedonia, but came over the country's eastern border with Bulgaria.\nIn the centre's strip-lighted, windowless meeting room, the overflowing ashtrays and half-drunk mugs of Turkish coffee suggest that it has been a stressful morning. The centre's manager, Vladimir Sjekloca, breaks off to explain the situation.\n\"There are always people in Belgrade,\" he says. \"Around 400-500 a day.\"\nVladimir says the increasing restrictions imposed by countries along the Balkan route - and finally its official closure (although hundreds of people have found a way through the border fence to cross from Greece into Macedonia) - have not stopped people seeking a way to western Europe. They have just changed the means.\n\"Coming in through Bulgaria - it's an old smuggling route and it'll be used more often. The Afghans tell us, 'It's cheaper to come that way [than the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece] and anyway we can't swim.'\"\nBefore its closure, countries along the route had been co-ordinating transport so that people would be taken from Macedonia to Slovenia's border with Austria on officially provided trains and buses. It was a reasonably smooth process which greatly reduced the possibility of refugees falling into the hands of people smugglers.\nBut now people who are desperate or determined to reach western Europe are once again dealing with unscrupulous elements.\n\"The journey through Bulgaria is full of ill-treatment,\" says Vladimir.\n\"People suffer at the hands of the mafia and people smugglers - and they don't get protection from the system. In fact, they can get ill-treated by the Bulgarian police or put in jail. They have set dogs on refugees - we've seen people with dog bites who've been severely beaten by the mafia or the police.\"\nSome of the people at the Asylum Information Centre have learned the hard way that people smugglers and even the authorities may not have their best interests at heart.\nAli Hashem Zade, a 27-year-old native of Tehran had hoped to find work in Europe to help support his two infant daughters.\nBut when Macedonia blocked entry to Iranians, he placed his trust in a trafficker from Pakistan.\n\"The smugglers were our only hope after they closed the border to Iranians. He took â‚¬250 (Â£195) from me - but he had a different price for everyone. He charged some people â‚¬1,400 - but he actually ran away, and I ended up wandering along the border for two days - I had to burn some of my clothes to start a fire,\" he says.\nAli says he found his way over the border by using his phone's GPS - but the same method did not work when he tried to cross from Serbia into Croatia. He claims the Croatian border police beat him and his friends when they caught them.\nStill, he means to try again.\n\"I have no money - so I will rely on God's will. It's better to rely on God than smugglers.\"\nOther people at the Asylum Information Centre are deciding to stay in Serbia - for now, at least. Taxis arrive to take the families to another asylum centre in Krnjaca, in the suburbs of Belgrade.\nIn the Yugoslav era, this rundown facility with the feel of a military barracks used to be workers' accommodation for an adjacent factory. Now the single-storey blocks house asylum seekers waiting for their claims to be processed. They share the facility with a handful of refugees displaced in the Balkans conflicts of the 1990s.\nIvan Miskovic from the government's Refugees Commissariat explains that people stranded when the Balkan route shut have a number of options. As well as asylum in Serbia they include repatriation, resettlement in a third country or an application to be reunited with family members who have already made it to western Europe.\n\"I think we did our job by offering them all the possibilities,\" he says. \"But our previous experience tells us that Serbia is not their destination, but their country of transit.\"\nSerbia has consistently taken a pragmatic approach to the refugee crisis - whether that has meant helping people on their way when the borders were open, or, more recently, mirroring the entry restrictions of neighbouring countries. Now there is a sense of realism about what the coming weeks might bring.\n\"The borders are not hermetically closed,\" says Ivan Miskovic. \"It is inevitable that more people will come in. Even if they come in an irregular fashion, they must be registered - and we can help them to be less vulnerable.\n\"But even if they start the asylum procedure [to stay in Serbia], they are simply buying time to leave the country when they find a suitable connection.\"\nIn other words, the Balkan route carries on.", "reference": "The Balkan route may officially be closed, but the Asylum Information Centre in Belgrade is very much open - and doing a roaring trade.", "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

The distinctive aroma of the refugee trail - damp, unwashed clothes - begins to fill the room.\n\"They are Yazidi people from Iraq,\" says Marjan, a translator struggling to find a common language with the new arrivals.\nThere are more than two dozen people in this extended family group. They did not follow the classic route to Serbia via Greece and Macedonia, but came over the country's eastern border with Bulgaria.\nIn the centre's strip-lighted, windowless meeting room, the overflowing ashtrays and half-drunk mugs of Turkish coffee suggest that it has been a stressful morning. The centre's manager, Vladimir Sjekloca, breaks off to explain the situation.\n\"There are always people in Belgrade,\" he says. \"Around 400-500 a day.\"\nVladimir says the increasing restrictions imposed by countries along the Balkan route - and finally its official closure (although hundreds of people have found a way through the border fence to cross from Greece into Macedonia) - have not stopped people seeking a way to western Europe. They have just changed the means.\n\"Coming in through Bulgaria - it's an old smuggling route and it'll be used more often. The Afghans tell us, 'It's cheaper to come that way [than the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece] and anyway we can't swim.'\"\nBefore its closure, countries along the route had been co-ordinating transport so that people would be taken from Macedonia to Slovenia's border with Austria on officially provided trains and buses. It was a reasonably smooth process which greatly reduced the possibility of refugees falling into the hands of people smugglers.\nBut now people who are desperate or determined to reach western Europe are once again dealing with unscrupulous elements.\n\"The journey through Bulgaria is full of ill-treatment,\" says Vladimir.\n\"People suffer at the hands of the mafia and people smugglers - and they don't get protection from the system. In fact, they can get ill-treated by the Bulgarian police or put in jail. They have set dogs on refugees - we've seen people with dog bites who've been severely beaten by the mafia or the police.\"\nSome of the people at the Asylum Information Centre have learned the hard way that people smugglers and even the authorities may not have their best interests at heart.\nAli Hashem Zade, a 27-year-old native of Tehran had hoped to find work in Europe to help support his two infant daughters.\nBut when Macedonia blocked entry to Iranians, he placed his trust in a trafficker from Pakistan.\n\"The smugglers were our only hope after they closed the border to Iranians. He took â‚¬250 (Â£195) from me - but he had a different price for everyone. He charged some people â‚¬1,400 - but he actually ran away, and I ended up wandering along the border for two days - I had to burn some of my clothes to start a fire,\" he says.\nAli says he found his way over the border by using his phone's GPS - but the same method did not work when he tried to cross from Serbia into Croatia. He claims the Croatian border police beat him and his friends when they caught them.\nStill, he means to try again.\n\"I have no money - so I will rely on God's will. It's better to rely on God than smugglers.\"\nOther people at the Asylum Information Centre are deciding to stay in Serbia - for now, at least. Taxis arrive to take the families to another asylum centre in Krnjaca, in the suburbs of Belgrade.\nIn the Yugoslav era, this rundown facility with the feel of a military barracks used to be workers' accommodation for an adjacent factory. Now the single-storey blocks house asylum seekers waiting for their claims to be processed. They share the facility with a handful of refugees displaced in the Balkans conflicts of the 1990s.\nIvan Miskovic from the government's Refugees Commissariat explains that people stranded when the Balkan route shut have a number of options. As well as asylum in Serbia they include repatriation, resettlement in a third country or an application to be reunited with family members who have already made it to western Europe.\n\"I think we did our job by offering them all the possibilities,\" he says. \"But our previous experience tells us that Serbia is not their destination, but their country of transit.\"\nSerbia has consistently taken a pragmatic approach to the refugee crisis - whether that has meant helping people on their way when the borders were open, or, more recently, mirroring the entry restrictions of neighbouring countries. Now there is a sense of realism about what the coming weeks might bring.\n\"The borders are not hermetically closed,\" says Ivan Miskovic. \"It is inevitable that more people will come in. Even if they come in an irregular fashion, they must be registered - and we can help them to be less vulnerable.\n\"But even if they start the asylum procedure [to stay in Serbia], they are simply buying time to leave the country when they find a suitable connection.\"\nIn other words, the Balkan route carries on.\n\nSummary:"}

{"id": "eval-2969", "document": "The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000.\nThe aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe.\nIn particular, the project wants every school to have a connection.\nBuilding so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus.\nIt can take Europe’s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today’s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost.\nThat means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.\nThe idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece.\nThe boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy.\n\"Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc.\n\"Here, we’ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,\" he told BBC News.\nAirbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida.\nThe most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the \"revolution\" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan.\nThe first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year.\nAnother batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace.\nThe establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.\nMore than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth.\nThere should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade.\nOneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.\nEquity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a \"truly global company\" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority.\n\"A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,\" said OneWeb CEO Eric Béranger.\n\"And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries.\"\nOne aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions.\nThe fear is that space could eventually become unusable.\nA recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other.\nBrian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation.\n\"We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit.\"\nTime will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole.\nAirbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines.

When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,” said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "reference": "European aerospace giant Airbus and its partner, OneWeb, have begun the production of a satellite mega-constellation.", "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant. Summarize the following news article into one, concise sentence capturing the main point.\n\nArticle:\nThe network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000.\nThe aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe.\nIn particular, the project wants every school to have a connection.\nBuilding so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus.\nIt can take Europe’s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today’s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost.\nThat means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.\nThe idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece.\nThe boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy.\n\"Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc.\n\"Here, we’ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,\" he told BBC News.\nAirbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida.\nThe most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the \"revolution\" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan.\nThe first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year.\nAnother batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace.\nThe establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.\nMore than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth.\nThere should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade.\nOneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.\nEquity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a \"truly global company\" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority.\n\"A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,\" said OneWeb CEO Eric Béranger.\n\"And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries.\"\nOne aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions.\nThe fear is that space could eventually become unusable.\nA recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other.\nBrian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation.\n\"We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit.\"\nTime will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole.\nAirbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment.\n\"Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,” said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n\nSummary:"}

If you are taking away money from the sector, that's going to be very difficult to continue providing quality.\n\"I don't think the vast majority of agents out there are actually profiteering.\n\"There are costs in running these businesses that people are unaware of and as increased state regulation comes in, those costs continue to rise.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We are happy to consider how legislation on this might work.\n\"We want to look at the evidence from Scotland and see wider consultation to ensure that a ban on fees does not push rental costs up.\"\nThe next scheduled ballot for backbench bills is on 25 January.\n\nSummary:"}

{"id": "eval-11094", "document": "The 22-year-old student was assaulted and robbed by a gang of youths in a side street when he was in primary school.\nIt was a long time ago, but he still crosses the road if a large group of people are coming his way. After all, everyone in his family has been targeted in a similar fashion.\nFrance's ethnic Chinese population have long suffered casual racism and been stereotyped as easy targets for crime. But they say they have now reached breaking point.\nIn August, 49-year-old tailor and father-of-two Zhang Chaolin died in hospital after being attacked by three teenagers. He had been walking in a quiet street in the north Paris suburb of Aubervilliers.\nZhang was reportedly kicked in the sternum and fell, striking his head on the pavement.  The aim of the attack was allegedly to steal his friend's bag.\nThe tailor had nothing on him except sweets and cigarettes.\nIn response, on 4 September, at least 15,000 ethnic Chinese turned out in Paris's Place de la Republique to give vent to their deep feelings of insecurity.\nEstimated at more than 600,000 people, France has Europe's largest Chinese community. But they have not been in the country as long as more prominent migrant groups, including those from Africa.\nDavid was born in Paris to parents who migrated from China in the early 1990s. He says he has been asked publicly if he eats dogs, and has been called a \"spring roll head\".\nHe has also been told to \"go back to his own country\" and \"go and work with his little Chinese hands\".\nSuch jibes might be familiar to east Asian migrants and their descendants across the West. As with British Chinese, French Chinese say that racist comments toward them are tolerated, in a way that they are not for more established migrant communities.\nBut in France, there is a sense that Asian migrants are targeted with particularly nasty violence.\n\"[These attacks] are because of the beliefs they have about us,\" says David, who is too fearful to use his real name.\nA working-class and immigrant-heavy area, home to more than 1,200 mostly Chinese wholesalers, Aubervilliers is an important European textile centre. Buyers come from far and wide to haggle over Italian-made coats and Chinese-made shirts.\nActivists say at least 100 attacks against Chinese nationals were reported in the suburb in just the first seven months of this year. France does not keep statistics based on ethnicity, so it is difficult to know the real number of incidents.\nMeriem Derkaoui, the suburb's communist mayor, condemned Zhang's murder as \"racist targeting\".\nCommunity groups say such attacks are driven by a perception that Chinese people are weak, will not fight back and carry a lot of cash.\nDuring a recent trial of three youths accused of 11 attacks in a three-month span in Aubervilliers, the defendants insisted the ethnicity of their targets was just a coincidence. But when interrogated by police, they reportedly admitted to seeing Chinese people as \"easy targets\" with money on them.\nIn interviews with the BBC, several ethnic Chinese shopkeepers and residents of Aubervilliers said they felt that the level of violence was getting worse.\n\"It's getting out of hand. The situation had stabilised in recent years, but now it's broken out again,\" says Franky Song, 20, who works in a jeans shop in the CIFA Fashion Business Center. Inter-communal relations in the area have deteriorated, he adds.\nIn this shopping centre, home to a few hundred clothing wholesalers, everyone would know someone who had been assaulted, he said. \"We have the businesses, but not the build, so they take advantage of us.\"\nHeng, a middle-aged lady who has run a florist's with her husband in Aubervilliers for 17 years, joined the recent protests because of the \"horrible situation\" in the suburb. Her shop has been broken into twice, and her insurer will no longer cover it.\nThe anger of people like Franky and Heng is mostly directed towards the state, which they say has failed to protect them. Zhang's death was the final straw. It prompted a community normally regarded as quietly focused on work and family to take a public stand.\n\"Asian people are not used to being in the spotlight; they like to be in the shadows,\" says Frederic Chau, a well-known comedian and actor of Cambodian-Chinese descent. He has played a high-profile role in the \"Safety for All\" campaign, which previously organised demonstrations in 2010 and 2011.\n\"To be more than 20,000 people in the Place de la Republique to make this protest - it's not normal, for us, [especially] for my mother, my father, my uncles.\n\"But doing this is necessary because we have had enough. We have to do something to change the mentality in France.\"\nAs one of the Indochinese refugees who arrived in France in the 1970s with the legal right to residence, Frederic is part of an ethnic Chinese community considered better integrated in French society than their mainland Chinese counterparts.\nFrance's colonial history meant that some of these refugees from Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia - many, like Frederic, of Chinese descent - already spoke French.\nThe Chinese wholesale trade in Aubervilliers, on the other hand, is dominated by migrants from Wenzhou, a city in China's southeast known for its entrepreneurial migrants. They mostly arrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the first generation struggling with the French language.\nYa-Han Chuang researched the integration of Chinese migrants for her doctorate at Paris-Sorbonne University. She says that compared to the Indochinese, these mainland migrants have struggled to accrue \"cultural capital\".\n\"The fact that they tend to work in and inherit family enterprises creates some more barriers,\" she says.\nBut Rui Wang, the son of Wenzhounese migrants and president of the Association of French-Chinese Youth, belies the stereotypes.\nBorn in China but raised in France, he casually quotes French philosophers and sociologists like Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Pierre Bourdieu. Articulate and driven, he has written to Prime Minister Manuel Valls to warn him that the situation in places like Aubervilliers is \"explosive\".\nHe describes how husbands will pick up their wives and children from metro stations and schools in groups of five to six people for safety reasons.\nIn La Courneuve, near Aubervilliers, look-outs are posted near weddings to prevent robberies. Security information and patrols are coordinated via the WeChat messaging app.\n\"There is an anger that has accumulated for too long,\" Rui says.\nThe association's immediate demands are straightforward: more police and security resources. Since the demonstrations in August and September, extra police officers have been promised for Aubervilliers. But according to Rui, city hall says it cannot afford to provide more security cameras.\nThe mayor did not respond to requests for comment on these issues.\nThe recent protests have captured rare media and political attention for a community unused to the limelight. Alain Juppe, a former prime minister and likely presidential candidate, visited the family of Zhang Chaolin in early September.\nSpeaking to French-Chinese in the area, he condemned rising incidents of \"anti-Chinese racism\" and spoke of France \"finding harmony between its communities\".\nThis is equally important for Rui. He wants more support from the government for social projects that build links between different migrant communities.\nFrederic Chau, the actor, feels the same way. He describes his family home's doormat as being like a border between France and China when he was growing up: \"I rejected my origins, I wanted to be whiter than white\".\nNow, he has fully embraced his Cambodian and Chinese origins, and is proud of them.\nWhat France's Asians want now, Frederic says, is to be \"considered French\".\nWhen perceptions change, they hope a sense of security will follow.", "reference": "David Liu, a Chinese Frenchman, says he walks around Paris with \"fear in his chest\".", "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

But they have not been in the country as long as more prominent migrant groups, including those from Africa.\nDavid was born in Paris to parents who migrated from China in the early 1990s. He says he has been asked publicly if he eats dogs, and has been called a \"spring roll head\".\nHe has also been told to \"go back to his own country\" and \"go and work with his little Chinese hands\".\nSuch jibes might be familiar to east Asian migrants and their descendants across the West. As with British Chinese, French Chinese say that racist comments toward them are tolerated, in a way that they are not for more established migrant communities.\nBut in France, there is a sense that Asian migrants are targeted with particularly nasty violence.\n\"[These attacks] are because of the beliefs they have about us,\" says David, who is too fearful to use his real name.\nA working-class and immigrant-heavy area, home to more than 1,200 mostly Chinese wholesalers, Aubervilliers is an important European textile centre. Buyers come from far and wide to haggle over Italian-made coats and Chinese-made shirts.\nActivists say at least 100 attacks against Chinese nationals were reported in the suburb in just the first seven months of this year. France does not keep statistics based on ethnicity, so it is difficult to know the real number of incidents.\nMeriem Derkaoui, the suburb's communist mayor, condemned Zhang's murder as \"racist targeting\".\nCommunity groups say such attacks are driven by a perception that Chinese people are weak, will not fight back and carry a lot of cash.\nDuring a recent trial of three youths accused of 11 attacks in a three-month span in Aubervilliers, the defendants insisted the ethnicity of their targets was just a coincidence. But when interrogated by police, they reportedly admitted to seeing Chinese people as \"easy targets\" with money on them.\nIn interviews with the BBC, several ethnic Chinese shopkeepers and residents of Aubervilliers said they felt that the level of violence was getting worse.\n\"It's getting out of hand. The situation had stabilised in recent years, but now it's broken out again,\" says Franky Song, 20, who works in a jeans shop in the CIFA Fashion Business Center. Inter-communal relations in the area have deteriorated, he adds.\nIn this shopping centre, home to a few hundred clothing wholesalers, everyone would know someone who had been assaulted, he said. \"We have the businesses, but not the build, so they take advantage of us.\"\nHeng, a middle-aged lady who has run a florist's with her husband in Aubervilliers for 17 years, joined the recent protests because of the \"horrible situation\" in the suburb. Her shop has been broken into twice, and her insurer will no longer cover it.\nThe anger of people like Franky and Heng is mostly directed towards the state, which they say has failed to protect them. Zhang's death was the final straw. It prompted a community normally regarded as quietly focused on work and family to take a public stand.\n\"Asian people are not used to being in the spotlight; they like to be in the shadows,\" says Frederic Chau, a well-known comedian and actor of Cambodian-Chinese descent. He has played a high-profile role in the \"Safety for All\" campaign, which previously organised demonstrations in 2010 and 2011.\n\"To be more than 20,000 people in the Place de la Republique to make this protest - it's not normal, for us, [especially] for my mother, my father, my uncles.\n\"But doing this is necessary because we have had enough. We have to do something to change the mentality in France.\"\nAs one of the Indochinese refugees who arrived in France in the 1970s with the legal right to residence, Frederic is part of an ethnic Chinese community considered better integrated in French society than their mainland Chinese counterparts.\nFrance's colonial history meant that some of these refugees from Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia - many, like Frederic, of Chinese descent - already spoke French.\nThe Chinese wholesale trade in Aubervilliers, on the other hand, is dominated by migrants from Wenzhou, a city in China's southeast known for its entrepreneurial migrants. They mostly arrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the first generation struggling with the French language.\nYa-Han Chuang researched the integration of Chinese migrants for her doctorate at Paris-Sorbonne University. She says that compared to the Indochinese, these mainland migrants have struggled to accrue \"cultural capital\".\n\"The fact that they tend to work in and inherit family enterprises creates some more barriers,\" she says.\nBut Rui Wang, the son of Wenzhounese migrants and president of the Association of French-Chinese Youth, belies the stereotypes.\nBorn in China but raised in France, he casually quotes French philosophers and sociologists like Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Pierre Bourdieu. Articulate and driven, he has written to Prime Minister Manuel Valls to warn him that the situation in places like Aubervilliers is \"explosive\".\nHe describes how husbands will pick up their wives and children from metro stations and schools in groups of five to six people for safety reasons.\nIn La Courneuve, near Aubervilliers, look-outs are posted near weddings to prevent robberies. Security information and patrols are coordinated via the WeChat messaging app.\n\"There is an anger that has accumulated for too long,\" Rui says.\nThe association's immediate demands are straightforward: more police and security resources. Since the demonstrations in August and September, extra police officers have been promised for Aubervilliers. But according to Rui, city hall says it cannot afford to provide more security cameras.\nThe mayor did not respond to requests for comment on these issues.\nThe recent protests have captured rare media and political attention for a community unused to the limelight. Alain Juppe, a former prime minister and likely presidential candidate, visited the family of Zhang Chaolin in early September.\nSpeaking to French-Chinese in the area, he condemned rising incidents of \"anti-Chinese racism\" and spoke of France \"finding harmony between its communities\".\nThis is equally important for Rui. He wants more support from the government for social projects that build links between different migrant communities.\nFrederic Chau, the actor, feels the same way. He describes his family home's doormat as being like a border between France and China when he was growing up: \"I rejected my origins, I wanted to be whiter than white\".\nNow, he has fully embraced his Cambodian and Chinese origins, and is proud of them.\nWhat France's Asians want now, Frederic says, is to be \"considered French\".\nWhen perceptions change, they hope a sense of security will follow.\n\nSummary:"}

I am unable to access any form of internet service in my house.\n\"Generally, the regime is baring its bloodied fangs and claws for all to see. This has not been an electoral process. This is a creeping military coup.\"\nIt was the fourth time Mr Besigye, candidate for the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, had taken on President Museveni.\nThe two men were once allies, with Mr Besigye serving as Mr Museveni's personal doctor when they were guerrilla fighters.\nHe was placed under house arrest ostensibly to stop him announcing his vote score unilaterally.\nMr Museveni seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda. However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian.\nThe next closest challenger to Mr Museveni, former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, is also reportedly under house arrest.\nThe National Resistance Movement put out a statement celebrating the win, saying Mr Museveni's opponents had \"failed to offer any alternative\".\nUganda's old guard tries new election tactics\n\nSummary:"}

You can't have a billionaire sitting on a publisher's board who is suing other people for publishing things.\n\"So, if you think of Facebook as being a publisher, this is plainly problematic.\"\nThe clash between Gawker and Mr Thiel dates back to 2007, when the media firm published an article headlined: \"Peter Thiel is totally gay people\".\nLast week, the venture capitalist revealed to the New York Times that he had subsequently funded a team of lawyers to find and help \"victims\" of other Gawker articles sue the firm - an act he described as \"philanthropic\".\nOne case resulted in a jury ordering Gawker to pay Hulk Hogan $140m (Â£97m) after it decided the publication of a sex tape featuring the ex-professional wrestler amounted to an invasion of privacy.\nGawker is appealing against the ruling, which threatens its future.\nThe publisher has also challenged Mr Thiel's involvement and questioned his continued role at the social network.\n\"As a Facebook board member, how have your own views on politics and news influenced your contribution to corporate decisions?\" asked Gawker's founder Nick Denton in an open letter.\nJeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post newspaper, was critical of Mr Thiel earlier in the week during his own appearance at the Code Conference.\n\"I don't think a billionaire should be able to fund a lawsuit to kill Gawker,\" he said.\n\"Seek revenge and you dig two graves. One for yourself.\"\nFacebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg rebuked one of its other directors, Marc Andreessen, earlier in the year for criticising India's action against the firm's Free Basics scheme.\nBut Ms Sandberg said the circumstances involving Mr Thiel were different.\n\"[In the earlier case] it almost felt like he was speaking for Facebook,\" she explained.\nEven so, one company watcher suggested Ms Sandberg's comments were unlikely to end the matter.\n\"Media critics clearly see Thiel's actions as a threat to free speech, if not the entire news business,\" said Graham Lovelace from Lovelace Consulting.\n\"Some are trying to bring Facebook into that, because of its record in championing free expression.\n\"It highlights the debate around Facebook's identity as it continues to grow.\"\nShareholders in the social network have an opportunity to question its decision at its annual stockholder meeting on 20 June.\n\nSummary:"}

{"id": "eval-7331", "document": "Should Scotland be an independent country?\nAnd for some those six words printed on four million ballot papers did not allow for any kind of doubt.\nFor the true believers it was simple, Scotland was a nation.\nNot for these purists the distraction of debate, obsessing over the price of oil and the return on government gilts.\nNo. They took a long, if not particularly fashionable view which conjured up battles and spirits of old, ghosts of men who fought for Scotland's freedom in the 13th and 14th centuries: William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, Andrew de Moray.\nSome who thirsted for independence drew inspiration from the Jacobite risings which attempted to restore the House of Stuart to the British throne in the 18th century.\nOthers remembered the short-lived 1820 insurrection by the Lanarkshire weaver James Wilson and his fellow radicals who were hanged for rising up to demand parliamentary reform.\nAnd yet such undiluted historical nationalism was a largely private affair.\nWilson's slogan \"Scotland Free, or a Desert\", which in the 1980s you would see daubed on Scottish motorway bridges in sloppy white paint, did not feature in 2014.\nThose days are past now. And in the past, it seems, they must remain.\n\"You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose,\" said the late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo. Not in Scotland.\nThe independence campaign of 2014 was almost entirely prosaic, with advocates focusing on what the late Professor Sir Neil McCormick called a \"utilitarian nationalism\" which desired independence as \"the best means to the well-being of the Scottish people.\"\nThis was a battle not in memory of Stirling Bridge or Bannockburn nor to avenge Flodden or Culloden but for Scotland's wallets.\n\"Yes\" lost, of course.\nScotland awoke on a damp, drizzly autumn morning in 2014 to a decisive, if not overwhelming, endorsement of the Union: 44.7% had said yes to independence, 55.3% had said no.\nWhy?\nA feeling has taken hold among some of \"the 45\", as the losers quickly became styled, that Scotland was cheated; that a powerful cabal of business, media and even the security apparatus of the British state combined to bully and frighten folk into voting no.\nScottish referendum results in detail\nAnd certainly the establishment message about independence, as promulgated by an almost entirely hostile press, was strikingly negative, despite many \"No\" voters holding a positive, even romantic view of the union.\nDuring the campaign, supporters of the UK often said they felt sadness and dismay at the prospect of a 300-year-old relationship ending in divorce.\nMany Scottish citizens were born south of the border — census data put the number eligible to vote in the referendum at 422,386 — and many more Scots had personal connections, or simply an affinity with England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThere were plenty of Scots for whom a commitment to the union was not a pragmatic calculation. It was simply about being British, feeling at home in London and Edinburgh, in Glasgow and Liverpool, in Aberdeen and Newcastle; about having close friends, family and colleagues north and south of the Cheviots.\nAnd yet with rare exceptions, such as a passionate speech by the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, \"Better Together\" campaigners for Britain were as prosaic as their opponents.\nCommonality of language; three centuries and more of shared history; the creation of the welfare state; the bond of standing together to defeat fascism: all were drowned out by a message of economic and even geopolitical doom.\nScotland, it was suggested, would be impoverished by going it alone, interest rates would soar, businesses would flee. In short, Scots would suffer.\nThe former secretary general of NATO, Lord George Robertson, who once predicted that the revival of the old Scots Parliament as a devolved legislature would \"kill nationalism stone dead\", even warned that independence would be \"cataclysmic\" for the western world. It would be welcomed by the global \"forces of darkness,\" he intoned.\nMany supporters of independence were stunned by the range and ferocity of the attacks and were shocked at how robustly their proposition was scrutinised.\nIf only every second news story ended with a line about how wonderful everything would be in an independent Scotland they suggested, absurdly, then the people would see the light.\nAt least one prominent critic of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign has a rather different take.\n\"In the September 2014 referendum, Yes failed to win the economic arguments,\" he wrote in a critique six months after the vote, because it \"failed to present a case on the currency, a central bank and fiscal policy that was credible.\"\nThe critic is no cheerleader for the union. He is Gordon Wilson, leader of the Scottish National Party from 1979 to 1990.\nJim Sillars, a former deputy leader of the party, has also criticised its strategy, writing that the campaign was \"handicapped by an SNP White Paper that, on at least two counts (a currency union and 10 per cent cut in corporation tax), was a gift to the No side.\"\nSince Mr Wilson's review of the referendum six months ago, the economic argument has not become any easier for those who say Scotland would be better off by seceding from the UK.\nThe figures and the arguments are, by now, wearily familiar to Scots: in 2013/14, Scotland paid £400 more per head in tax than the UK as a whole. This includes revenue from oil and gas in Scottish waters, in other words the lion's share of tax from Britain's North Sea operations.\nSo far so good for a nationalist.\nBut with £400 more per head in contributions, Scots received £1,200 more per head than the UK average in spending.\n£400\nScots pay more per head in tax than the UK average\n£1,200\nScots receive more per head than UK average\nCampaigners against independence call this hefty £800 per head a \"union dividend\", warning that if Scotland had control of all taxation and domestic spending, even in an arrangement that stopped short of full independence, it would face deep cuts to public services or big tax rises.\nNationalists retort that Scotland, like practically all nations including the UK, could borrow money and run a deficit while it designed policies better suited to improving growth and productivity.\nBut right now the starting point for such an ambitious project looks tough. The latest official figures for borrowing as a share of economic output - a sensible measure of how much debt a country can sustain - show that Scotland was performing considerably worse than the UK average in 2013/14, with a deficit of 8.1% of GDP compared to the UK's 5.6%.\nNot only that but assuming a future independent Scotland wanted to use sterling, a currency union would be likely to face the same objections raised during the referendum campaign.\nAnd, for all the recent insistence of nationalists that oil is nothing more than a bonus for Scotland, the slump in price to a value way below even the Scottish government's most pessimistic forecast, along with thousands of job losses in and around Aberdeen, can hardly be regarded as inconsequential.\nAnd so nationalism remains in danger of being ensnared by Catch-22. If Scotland is struggling so badly in the union, how can it afford to go it alone? If it is thriving, why bother?\nEither way, having chosen to campaign on utilitarian ground, and having trumpeted the very same official figures on previous occasions when they were more favourable to independence, the SNP can hardly complain that a majority of voters weighed up the risks and decided not to take them.\nNonetheless the very fact that many who voted \"No\" said they might have voted \"Yes\" had the economic outlook been more favourable suggests that something was afoot, a feeling that has only increased in the year following the poll.\nNot so long ago Scottish nationalism felt like a fringe activity, pursued by the kind of man who wore a kilt on a Tuesday afternoon.\nThen, with the opening of the devolved parliament in 1999, the centre of Scotland's political life shifted to Edinburgh and within a decade everything had changed.\nIn 2007 the SNP won control of the devolved government and this May, just seven months after its raison d'être was rejected in a supposed \"once-in-a-generation\" vote, it swept the board at the general election, taking 56 of Scotland's 59 seats in the House of Commons.\nNationalism was not \"stone dead\" but alive and thriving. The country, it seemed, had heard something that it liked after all, a positive message about a brighter future.\nThis thirst for change was in tune with other European countries where anger about out-of-touch politicians and arrogant bankers following the financial crisis of 2007/8 was transformed, for a time at least, into a rebellion against The System.\nLike voters in Greece, Spain, Italy and elsewhere, Scottish citizens have found somewhere to channel a previously inchoate feeling that 21st century capitalist democracies are \"gamed\" in favour of a wealthy elite.\nWhether or not this feeling is accurate — and whether or not nationalism is the answer — are of course questions open to debate. But whether or not the feeling is real is surely not in doubt; indeed the same forces are now having an extraordinary effect on the Labour Party.\nYou might call it a \"Paisley Pattern\" after the rejection by that town of the polished and precise Douglas Alexander, who ran Labour's general election campaign and was preparing to take up the post of foreign secretary, in favour of the passionate 20-year-old Mhairi Black of the SNP, now the youngest MP of the democratic era.\nBright, optimistic and raw, with her insistence that the Labour party left her, rather than the other way around, Ms Black personifies the shift to the SNP.\nOn a bright spring day a fortnight before the general election, we watched her bounce up the street, blonde hair pulled tight in a ponytail, a messenger's bag slung over her shoulder, charming voters with a sympathetic ear and a smile.\nShe looked like the anti-politician's politician.\n\"We triumphed on a wave of hope\" she said later in a powerful maiden speech which became an internet sensation, \"something different, something better\".\nWe triumphed on a wave of hope - something different, something better.\"\nIt is this kind of vague optimism which is proving hard for the SNP's challengers to oppose and which now makes the strategy of economic doom from supporters of the union look short-sighted.\nAfter all, when Glasgow has voted to leave the UK, something is up. Glasgow! The second city of the British Empire; bombed in the Blitz when Britain stood together against the Nazis; cradle of the pan-British Labour movement — a majority in Glasgow said they wanted independence for Scotland.\nAnd while only Dundee, West Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire followed suit last September, there was evidence even in the \"No\" vote of a loosening of ties.\nResearch carried out immediately after the referendum suggested that far more \"No\" voters across Scotland rejected independence primarily because the economic risks were too great than did so because of a strong attachment to the UK and its shared history, culture and traditions.\nSince then every plan to devolve further power from Westminster to Holyrood seems only to encourage greater support for the SNP and its calls for even more devolution, while attempts to design a stable federal solution for the UK have stalled not least because the Liberal Democrats, who should by rights be inking the blueprints, are in disarray.\nAnd so the question for supporters of the United Kingdom is this: if the message that money is all that matters continues to be the dominant one in the minds of voters, then what actually binds the country together?\nIf it is nothing more than coins, notes and loans then perhaps the UK is fraying at the edges after all.\nA perception, encouraged by all three major UK parties before the referendum, that the union relies on relatively poor Scotland being dependent in perpetuity on English subsidy might have looked like the best way to win last September's referendum but even if it was accurate, how durable, popular and attractive is such a downbeat, even cynical, message in the longer run?\nThe SNP's stunning general election landslide hints at one answer - and these days the question is being asked south as well as north of the border with a rise in English nationalism and proposals to reduce the influence of Scottish MPs at Westminster prompting Gordon Brown to warn that \"the union is in mortal danger.\"\nThere may yet come a day when England wants Scotland to leave the UK.\nMeanwhile the SNP leader, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon continues to walk on water and the party's electoral lustre remains apparently undimmed as it skilfully keeps the focus on \"Westminster austerity\" and the Conservative Party's mission to slim the state by slashing public spending, a political philosophy which happens to be rather unpopular in Scotland.\nThe devolved SNP government's popularity by contrast is all the more remarkable when you consider the serious difficulties it faces after eight years in power in the areas it does control, including;\nPerhaps the party has become a victim of its own success as well as its opponents' weaknesses. Perhaps slick professionalism, clever marketing and unflinching loyalty from supporters and parliamentarians do not make for effective scrutiny of government policies.\nAnd there are big problems ahead for the SNP as it poses as a radical socialist party while embracing the neo-liberal economic consensus which has prevailed since Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, problems that will only become thornier with Jeremy Corbyn leading the Labour Party on to genuinely Left-wing ground.\nHow many of the SNP's policies, apart from unilateral nuclear disarmament and arguably land reform could be regarded as genuinely radical?\nThe conundrum for the nationalists has not changed, how can they convince Middle Scotland that independence is a benign project while at the same time presenting it to those who rarely or never vote as something close to a revolution?\nWell, not by insulting people for a start.\nWhile the \"Better Together\" campaign preferred to do its hectoring in private last year - with one senior figure from the Labour Party literally slamming the door as he stormed out of a meeting with the BBC for example - the SNP leader Alex Salmond appeared content to allow certain online supporters, dubbed \"cybernats\", to take a far more public approach to rubbishing anyone who dared question them.\nThus Scotland's most successful modern author JK Rowling and its greatest Olympian Sir Chris Hoy were both abused online, as were thoughtful pro-Union commentators such as David Torrance, Chris Deerin and Alex Massie, painted not just as political opponents or sceptical journalists but as enemies of Scotland, traitors, Quislings and so on.\nSuch language appeared designed to delegitimise anyone who asked difficult questions rather than to engage them in meaningful debate.\nWhereas Mr Salmond was fond of dealing with such criticism by pointing out instances of unionists abusing nationalists online, Ms Sturgeon has taken a more robust approach, slapping down social media users who make offensive remarks in the name of the nationalist movement.\nThis First Minister appears to understand that hectoring and harassing voters does not tend to win them over.\nStill, there are many people in Scotland for whom 2014 remains a year to forget, a divisive, unnecessary distraction from the challenges of the 21st century. Some felt uncomfortable in their own country and keep quiet still about their \"Britishness\" and support for the United Kingdom.\nBut there are many others who regard last year as a turning of the tide, a beginning rather than an end, an opportunity for change.\nAnd with a utilitarian narrative firmly embedded in the minds of Scottish voters it is not too difficult to imagine a shift that puts the union under pressure again.\nConsider these questions;\nPerhaps these particular scenarios are unrealistic but the point is that with the SNP so strong, discontent with the status quo bubbling over, and most of the debate reduced to practicalities alone, it is not difficult to conjure up situations where Scottish independence is suddenly thrust back to the top of the agenda.\nIt is as clear as the water in that Angus burn that the debate about Scotland's future is far from over.", "reference": "It was an elegant question, as clear as the chill water in an Angus burn.", "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant. Summarize the following news article into one, concise sentence capturing the main point.\n\nArticle:\nShould Scotland be an independent country?\nAnd for some those six words printed on four million ballot papers did not allow for any kind of doubt.\nFor the true believers it was simple, Scotland was a nation.\nNot for these purists the distraction of debate, obsessing over the price of oil and the return on government gilts.\nNo. They took a long, if not particularly fashionable view which conjured up battles and spirits of old, ghosts of men who fought for Scotland's freedom in the 13th and 14th centuries: William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, Andrew de Moray.\nSome who thirsted for independence drew inspiration from the Jacobite risings which attempted to restore the House of Stuart to the British throne in the 18th century.\nOthers remembered the short-lived 1820 insurrection by the Lanarkshire weaver James Wilson and his fellow radicals who were hanged for rising up to demand parliamentary reform.\nAnd yet such undiluted historical nationalism was a largely private affair.\nWilson's slogan \"Scotland Free, or a Desert\", which in the 1980s you would see daubed on Scottish motorway bridges in sloppy white paint, did not feature in 2014.\nThose days are past now. And in the past, it seems, they must remain.\n\"You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose,\" said the late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo. Not in Scotland.\nThe independence campaign of 2014 was almost entirely prosaic, with advocates focusing on what the late Professor Sir Neil McCormick called a \"utilitarian nationalism\" which desired independence as \"the best means to the well-being of the Scottish people.\"\nThis was a battle not in memory of Stirling Bridge or Bannockburn nor to avenge Flodden or Culloden but for Scotland's wallets.\n\"Yes\" lost, of course.\nScotland awoke on a damp, drizzly autumn morning in 2014 to a decisive, if not overwhelming, endorsement of the Union: 44.7% had said yes to independence, 55.3% had said no.\nWhy?\nA feeling has taken hold among some of \"the 45\", as the losers quickly became styled, that Scotland was cheated; that a powerful cabal of business, media and even the security apparatus of the British state combined to bully and frighten folk into voting no.\nScottish referendum results in detail\nAnd certainly the establishment message about independence, as promulgated by an almost entirely hostile press, was strikingly negative, despite many \"No\" voters holding a positive, even romantic view of the union.\nDuring the campaign, supporters of the UK often said they felt sadness and dismay at the prospect of a 300-year-old relationship ending in divorce.\nMany Scottish citizens were born south of the border — census data put the number eligible to vote in the referendum at 422,386 — and many more Scots had personal connections, or simply an affinity with England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThere were plenty of Scots for whom a commitment to the union was not a pragmatic calculation. It was simply about being British, feeling at home in London and Edinburgh, in Glasgow and Liverpool, in Aberdeen and Newcastle; about having close friends, family and colleagues north and south of the Cheviots.\nAnd yet with rare exceptions, such as a passionate speech by the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, \"Better Together\" campaigners for Britain were as prosaic as their opponents.\nCommonality of language; three centuries and more of shared history; the creation of the welfare state; the bond of standing together to defeat fascism: all were drowned out by a message of economic and even geopolitical doom.\nScotland, it was suggested, would be impoverished by going it alone, interest rates would soar, businesses would flee. In short, Scots would suffer.\nThe former secretary general of NATO, Lord George Robertson, who once predicted that the revival of the old Scots Parliament as a devolved legislature would \"kill nationalism stone dead\", even warned that independence would be \"cataclysmic\" for the western world. It would be welcomed by the global \"forces of darkness,\" he intoned.\nMany supporters of independence were stunned by the range and ferocity of the attacks and were shocked at how robustly their proposition was scrutinised.\nIf only every second news story ended with a line about how wonderful everything would be in an independent Scotland they suggested, absurdly, then the people would see the light.\nAt least one prominent critic of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign has a rather different take.\n\"In the September 2014 referendum, Yes failed to win the economic arguments,\" he wrote in a critique six months after the vote, because it \"failed to present a case on the currency, a central bank and fiscal policy that was credible.\"\nThe critic is no cheerleader for the union. He is Gordon Wilson, leader of the Scottish National Party from 1979 to 1990.\nJim Sillars, a former deputy leader of the party, has also criticised its strategy, writing that the campaign was \"handicapped by an SNP White Paper that, on at least two counts (a currency union and 10 per cent cut in corporation tax), was a gift to the No side.\"\nSince Mr Wilson's review of the referendum six months ago, the economic argument has not become any easier for those who say Scotland would be better off by seceding from the UK.\nThe figures and the arguments are, by now, wearily familiar to Scots: in 2013/14, Scotland paid £400 more per head in tax than the UK as a whole. This includes revenue from oil and gas in Scottish waters, in other words the lion's share of tax from Britain's North Sea operations.\nSo far so good for a nationalist.\nBut with £400 more per head in contributions, Scots received £1,200 more per head than the UK average in spending.\n£400\nScots pay more per head in tax than the UK average\n£1,200\nScots receive more per head than UK average\nCampaigners against independence call this hefty £800 per head a \"union dividend\", warning that if Scotland had control of all taxation and domestic spending, even in an arrangement that stopped short of full independence, it would face deep cuts to public services or big tax rises.\nNationalists retort that Scotland, like practically all nations including the UK, could borrow money and run a deficit while it designed policies better suited to improving growth and productivity.\nBut right now the starting point for such an ambitious project looks tough. The latest official figures for borrowing as a share of economic output - a sensible measure of how much debt a country can sustain - show that Scotland was performing considerably worse than the UK average in 2013/14, with a deficit of 8.1% of GDP compared to the UK's 5.6%.\nNot only that but assuming a future independent Scotland wanted to use sterling, a currency union would be likely to face the same objections raised during the referendum campaign.\nAnd, for all the recent insistence of nationalists that oil is nothing more than a bonus for Scotland, the slump in price to a value way below even the Scottish government's most pessimistic forecast, along with thousands of job losses in and around Aberdeen, can hardly be regarded as inconsequential.\nAnd so nationalism remains in danger of being ensnared by Catch-22. If Scotland is struggling so badly in the union, how can it afford to go it alone? If it is thriving, why bother?\nEither way, having chosen to campaign on utilitarian ground, and having trumpeted the very same official figures on previous occasions when they were more favourable to independence, the SNP can hardly complain that a majority of voters weighed up the risks and decided not to take them.\nNonetheless the very fact that many who voted \"No\" said they might have voted \"Yes\" had the economic outlook been more favourable suggests that something was afoot, a feeling that has only increased in the year following the poll.\nNot so long ago Scottish nationalism felt like a fringe activity, pursued by the kind of man who wore a kilt on a Tuesday afternoon.\nThen, with the opening of the devolved parliament in 1999, the centre of Scotland's political life shifted to Edinburgh and within a decade everything had changed.\nIn 2007 the SNP won control of the devolved government and this May, just seven months after its raison d'être was rejected in a supposed \"once-in-a-generation\" vote, it swept the board at the general election, taking 56 of Scotland's 59 seats in the House of Commons.\nNationalism was not \"stone dead\" but alive and thriving. The country, it seemed, had heard something that it liked after all, a positive message about a brighter future.\nThis thirst for change was in tune with other European countries where anger about out-of-touch politicians and arrogant bankers following the financial crisis of 2007/8 was transformed, for a time at least, into a rebellion against The System.\nLike voters in Greece, Spain, Italy and elsewhere, Scottish citizens have found somewhere to channel a previously inchoate feeling that 21st century capitalist democracies are \"gamed\" in favour of a wealthy elite.\nWhether or not this feeling is accurate — and whether or not nationalism is the answer — are of course questions open to debate. But whether or not the feeling is real is surely not in doubt; indeed the same forces are now having an extraordinary effect on the Labour Party.\nYou might call it a \"Paisley Pattern\" after the rejection by that town of the polished and precise Douglas Alexander, who ran Labour's general election campaign and was preparing to take up the post of foreign secretary, in favour of the passionate 20-year-old Mhairi Black of the SNP, now the youngest MP of the democratic era.\nBright, optimistic and raw, with her insistence that the Labour party left her, rather than the other way around, Ms Black personifies the shift to the SNP.\nOn a bright spring day a fortnight before the general election, we watched her bounce up the street, blonde hair pulled tight in a ponytail, a messenger's bag slung over her shoulder, charming voters with a sympathetic ear and a smile.\nShe looked like the anti-politician's politician.\n\"We triumphed on a wave of hope\" she said later in a powerful maiden speech which became an internet sensation, \"something different, something better\".\nWe triumphed on a wave of hope - something different, something better.\"\nIt is this kind of vague optimism which is proving hard for the SNP's challengers to oppose and which now makes the strategy of economic doom from supporters of the union look short-sighted.\nAfter all, when Glasgow has voted to leave the UK, something is up.

In this, they differ from many Europeans.\nAnd this points to a philosophical problem about asking the likes of Google and Facebook to police the internet more closely.\nDo we really want private companies - who have what critics argue is a global monopoly - to censor ever more of our lives?\nHaving completely reinvented our public domain in a very, very short space of time, asking tech giants to now do more to tackle extremism, whether Muslim, anti-Muslim or whatever, gives them a social role we may not like the implications of when we think about it.\nOf course, with their immense power must come immense responsibility - from paying taxes properly to submitting themselves to greater public scrutiny (something they far too often run scared of).\nBut for the practical and philosophical reasons I outline, responding to the political imperative for something to be done on hateful online content is as complicated as it is vital.\n\nSummary:"}

Those numbers appear to be increasing.\n\"I've just projected about five weeks into the future and if current trends persist we would be seeing not hundreds of cases per week, but thousands of cases per week and that is terribly disturbing.\n\"The situation is bad and we have to prepare for it getting worse.\"\nThe World Health Organization is using an educated guess of 20,000 cases before the end, in order to plan the scale of the response.\nBut the true potential of the outbreak is unknown and the WHO figure has been described to me as optimistic by some scientists.\nThe outbreak started in Gueckedou in Guinea, on the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nBut it has spread significantly with the WHO reporting that \"for the first time since the outbreak began\" that the majority of cases in the past week were outside of that epicentre with the capital cities becoming major centres of Ebola.\nAdditionally one person took the infection to Nigeria, where it has since spread in a small cluster and there has been an isolated case in Senegal.\nProf Simon Hay, from the University of Oxford, will publish his scientific analysis of the changing face of Ebola outbreaks in the next week.\nHe warns that as the total number of cases increases, so does the risk of international spread.\nHe told me: \"I think you're going to have more and more of these individual cases seeding into new areas, continued flows into Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, and all the countries in between, so I'm not very optimistic at the moment that we're containing this epidemic.\"\nThere is always the risk that one of these cases could arrive in Europe or North America.\nHowever, richer countries have the facilities to prevent an isolated case becoming an uncontrolled outbreak.\nThe worry is that other African countries with poor resources would not cope and find themselves in a similar situation to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\"Nigeria is the one I look at with great concern. If things started to get out of control in Nigeria I really think that, because of its connectedness and size, that could be quite alarming,\" said Prof Hay.\nIt is also unclear when this outbreak will be over.\nOfficially the World Health Organization is saying the outbreak can be contained in six to nine months. But that is based on getting the resources to tackle the outbreak, which are currently stretched too thinly to contain Ebola as it stands.\nThere have been nearly 4,000 cases so far, cases are increasing exponentially and there is a potentially vulnerable population in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea in excess of 20 million.\n11,315\nDeaths - probable, confirmed and suspected\n(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)\n4,809 Liberia\n3,955 Sierra Leone\n2,536 Guinea\n8 Nigeria\nProf Neil Ferguson, the director of the UK Medical Research Council's centre for outbreak analysis and modelling at Imperial College London, is providing data analysis for the World Health Organization.\nHe is convinced that the three countries will eventually get on top of the outbreak, but not without help from the rest of the world.\n\"The authorities are completely overwhelmed. All the trends are the epidemic is increasing, it's still growing exponentially, so there's certainly no reason for optimism.\n\"It is hard to make a long-term prognosis, but this is certainly something we'll be dealing with in 2015.\n\"I can well imagine that unless there is a ramp-up of the response on the ground, we'll have flare-ups of cases for several months and possibly years.\"\nIt is certainly a timeframe that could see an experimental Ebola vaccine, which began safety testing this week, being used on the front line.\nIf the early trials are successful then healthcare workers could be vaccinated in November this year.\nBut there are is also a fear being raised by some virologists that Ebola may never be contained.\nProf Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, describes the situation as \"desperate\".\nHis concern is that the virus is being given its first major opportunity to adapt to thrive in people, due to the large number of human-to-human transmissions of the virus during this outbreak of unprecedented scale.\nEbola is thought to come from fruit bats; humans are not its preferred host.\nBut like HIV and influenza, Ebola's genetic code is a strand of RNA. Think of RNA as the less stable cousin of DNA, which is where we keep our genetic information.\nIt means Ebola virus has a high rate of mutation and with mutation comes the possibility of adapting.\nProf Ball argues: \"It is increasing exponentially and the fatality rate seems to be decreasing, but why?\n\"Is it better medical care, earlier intervention or is the virus adapting to humans and becoming less pathogenic? As a virologist that's what I think is happening.\"\nThere is a relationship between how deadly a virus is and how easily it spreads. Generally speaking if a virus is less likely to kill you, then you are more likely to spread it - although smallpox was a notable exception.\nProf Ball said \"it really wouldn't surprise me\" if Ebola adapted, the death rate fell to around 5% and the outbreak never really ended.\n\"It is like HIV, which has been knocking away at human-to-human transmission for hundreds of years before eventually finding the right combo of beneficial mutations to spread through human populations.\"\nIt is also easy to focus just on Ebola when the outbreak is having a much wider impact on these countries.\nThe malaria season, which is generally in September and October in West Africa, is now starting.\nThis will present a number of issues. Will there be capacity to treat patients with malaria? Will people infected with malaria seek treatment if the nearest hospital is rammed with suspected Ebola cases? How will healthcare workers cope when malaria and Ebola both present with similar symptoms.\nAnd that nervousness about the safety of Ebola-rife hospitals could damage care yet further. Will pregnant women go to hospital to give birth or stay at home where any complications could be more deadly.\nThe collateral damage from Ebola is unlikely to be assessed until after the outbreak.\nNo matter where you look there is not much cause for optimism.\nThe biggest unknown in all of this is when there will be sufficient resources to properly tackle the outbreak.\nProf Neil Ferguson concludes: \"This summer has there have been many globally important news stories in Ukraine and the Middle East, but what we see unfolding in West Africa is a catastrophe to the population, killing thousands in the region now and we're seeing a breakdown of the fragile healthcare system.\n\"So I think it needs to move up the political agenda rather more rapidly than it has.\"", "reference": "This isn't just the worst single Ebola outbreak in history, it has now killed more than all the others combined.", "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

If things started to get out of control in Nigeria I really think that, because of its connectedness and size, that could be quite alarming,\" said Prof Hay.\nIt is also unclear when this outbreak will be over.\nOfficially the World Health Organization is saying the outbreak can be contained in six to nine months. But that is based on getting the resources to tackle the outbreak, which are currently stretched too thinly to contain Ebola as it stands.\nThere have been nearly 4,000 cases so far, cases are increasing exponentially and there is a potentially vulnerable population in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea in excess of 20 million.\n11,315\nDeaths - probable, confirmed and suspected\n(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)\n4,809 Liberia\n3,955 Sierra Leone\n2,536 Guinea\n8 Nigeria\nProf Neil Ferguson, the director of the UK Medical Research Council's centre for outbreak analysis and modelling at Imperial College London, is providing data analysis for the World Health Organization.\nHe is convinced that the three countries will eventually get on top of the outbreak, but not without help from the rest of the world.\n\"The authorities are completely overwhelmed. All the trends are the epidemic is increasing, it's still growing exponentially, so there's certainly no reason for optimism.\n\"It is hard to make a long-term prognosis, but this is certainly something we'll be dealing with in 2015.\n\"I can well imagine that unless there is a ramp-up of the response on the ground, we'll have flare-ups of cases for several months and possibly years.\"\nIt is certainly a timeframe that could see an experimental Ebola vaccine, which began safety testing this week, being used on the front line.\nIf the early trials are successful then healthcare workers could be vaccinated in November this year.\nBut there are is also a fear being raised by some virologists that Ebola may never be contained.\nProf Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, describes the situation as \"desperate\".\nHis concern is that the virus is being given its first major opportunity to adapt to thrive in people, due to the large number of human-to-human transmissions of the virus during this outbreak of unprecedented scale.\nEbola is thought to come from fruit bats; humans are not its preferred host.\nBut like HIV and influenza, Ebola's genetic code is a strand of RNA. Think of RNA as the less stable cousin of DNA, which is where we keep our genetic information.\nIt means Ebola virus has a high rate of mutation and with mutation comes the possibility of adapting.\nProf Ball argues: \"It is increasing exponentially and the fatality rate seems to be decreasing, but why?\n\"Is it better medical care, earlier intervention or is the virus adapting to humans and becoming less pathogenic? As a virologist that's what I think is happening.\"\nThere is a relationship between how deadly a virus is and how easily it spreads. Generally speaking if a virus is less likely to kill you, then you are more likely to spread it - although smallpox was a notable exception.\nProf Ball said \"it really wouldn't surprise me\" if Ebola adapted, the death rate fell to around 5% and the outbreak never really ended.\n\"It is like HIV, which has been knocking away at human-to-human transmission for hundreds of years before eventually finding the right combo of beneficial mutations to spread through human populations.\"\nIt is also easy to focus just on Ebola when the outbreak is having a much wider impact on these countries.\nThe malaria season, which is generally in September and October in West Africa, is now starting.\nThis will present a number of issues. Will there be capacity to treat patients with malaria? Will people infected with malaria seek treatment if the nearest hospital is rammed with suspected Ebola cases? How will healthcare workers cope when malaria and Ebola both present with similar symptoms.\nAnd that nervousness about the safety of Ebola-rife hospitals could damage care yet further. Will pregnant women go to hospital to give birth or stay at home where any complications could be more deadly.\nThe collateral damage from Ebola is unlikely to be assessed until after the outbreak.\nNo matter where you look there is not much cause for optimism.\nThe biggest unknown in all of this is when there will be sufficient resources to properly tackle the outbreak.\nProf Neil Ferguson concludes: \"This summer has there have been many globally important news stories in Ukraine and the Middle East, but what we see unfolding in West Africa is a catastrophe to the population, killing thousands in the region now and we're seeing a breakdown of the fragile healthcare system.\n\"So I think it needs to move up the political agenda rather more rapidly than it has.\"\n\nSummary:"}

Until there is evidence to the contrary, this time looks to be no different.\nLast week reporters raged over the fact that White House officials, from Vice-President Mike Pence on down, put forward an explanation regarding why the president had fired FBI Director James Comey that was completely undercut within moments of Mr Trump opening his mouth in a sit-down interview on Thursday with NBC News.\nThe president would later tweet that because he is a \"very active president\" his press team can't be relied upon to convey his positions with \"prefect accuracy\".\n\"Why were so many people giving answers that just weren't correct?\" Jonathan Karl asked Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \"Were you guys in the dark?\"\nNeedless to say reporters this week took the early White House spin that Mr Trump only discussed \"common threats\" with the Russians, per Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell, with more than a grain of salt. It appears their scepticism was at least partially validated when, on Tuesday morning, Mr Trump said he had shared \"facts pertaining to terrorism\" with Russia.\nPresidents and the media typically have an adversarial relationship, but this White House is rapidly burning through any residual goodwill it may have had.\nGiven that Mr Trump and his team often refer to the press as the \"opposition party\", however, the may not lose much sleep over this development.\nTwitter: @awzurcher\n\nSummary:"}

{"id": "eval-141", "document": "It's hard to tell which blow took us more by surprise, the first ever positive steroids test in the history of Scottish rugby, or the fact that  and think it's unfair that so many Scottish, Welsh and Irish teams qualify for the Heineken Cup from a league without relegation.\nBut let's start with  to bulk up and get on in rugby, and leave the Heineken Cup for another day.\nThe public statement made by Sam Chalmers, son of one of our finest ever players Craig, is that he is sorry and that he got the stuff off the internet. It has shades of the convenient \"lone wolf\" theory about it. Was he the only player to get this stuff? Did he talk to other players about it?\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand\nHere is my thinking: I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now.\nWhat I don't buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It's cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it's not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you.\nSome players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you're not big enough then choose another profession. It's not a game for all shapes and sizes any more.\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards.\nPerhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone.

However he's done that and he's been good.\"\nRoot has led Yorkshire four times in the County Championship, taking charge when the county secured the 2014 County Championship title after then-captain Andrew Gale was suspended.\nHe was also the on-field captain when Middlesex, led by Australian batsman Chris Rogers, made a record 472-3 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in the same year.\nAll-rounder Ben Stokes, who was vice-captain on the recent limited-overs tour of Bangladesh which regular ODI skipper Eoin Morgan missed, was described as a \"natural leader\" by his Durham skipper Paul Collingwood.\n\"Ben has got a natural draw to him and he would be an excellent vice-captain for Root,\" former England limited-overs captain Collingwood said on the Tuffers and Vaughan show.\n\"The captain will have leaders underneath him that he knows he can go to - I think Ben Stokes would be the perfect man for that.\"\nFast bowler Stuart Broad has also been mooted - he captained the Twenty20 side between 2011 and 2014 - and Anderson said: \"I wouldn't be against a fast bowler but one issue could be fitness.\n\"Bowlers get injured a lot more so are they going to play every game? The international schedule is hectic so it can be difficult.\"\nWicketkeeper Jos Buttler, who led the one-day side in Bangladesh in Morgan's absence and remains the official limited-overs vice-captain, has also been suggested as a possible candidate.\nHowever, the Lancashire player's Test place is not guaranteed given current keeper Jonny Bairstow's good form - although Buttler played as a specialist batsman in the last three Tests of the recent India series.\nEx-England spinner Graeme Swann told BBC Radio 5 live he felt the pressure of potential Test captaincy was already affecting Root's batting.\n\"I think we should leave Joe Root to be the best batsman this country has ever produced, which he would be without the burden of being the captain,\" he said.\nHowever, Kohli, along with Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, have each raised their games since becoming captains of their respective countries.\nSmith and Kohli are the two top-ranked Test batsmen, while Williamson is one of 13 men to have scored a Test century against all of the other nine Test-playing nations.\n\"It's very English to assume the captaincy will affect him. The other three have got captaincy of their country and gone to a different level with it,\" said ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan, who came through the same Sheffield Collegiate club side and Yorkshire academy ranks which produced Root, and has been a long-term mentor to the young right-hander.\n\"I don't think there's an issue with him captaining, he's too good a player. I think he'd be a good one.\n\"To captain any team you have to be loving the game, love the difficult moments and prove people wrong. He is that kind of character.\"\nEngland and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was named captain of the county in December 2016, said that his team-mate Root's inexperience was not an issue in him assuming the captaincy.\nThe pair lived together in 2011 during their early years in the Yorkshire first team and Ballance took Root's place when he was dropped for the final Test of England's Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14.\n\"I think both of us have probably matured a bit more as cricketers and people. He's ready as a leader now in that England changing room,\" Ballance told BBC World Service's Stumped programme.\n\"I think Rooty's a natural born leader. He's done it from a young age.

However he's done that and he's been good.\"\nRoot has led Yorkshire four times in the County Championship, taking charge when the county secured the 2014 County Championship title after then-captain Andrew Gale was suspended.\nHe was also the on-field captain when Middlesex, led by Australian batsman Chris Rogers, made a record 472-3 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in the same year.\nAll-rounder Ben Stokes, who was vice-captain on the recent limited-overs tour of Bangladesh which regular ODI skipper Eoin Morgan missed, was described as a \"natural leader\" by his Durham skipper Paul Collingwood.\n\"Ben has got a natural draw to him and he would be an excellent vice-captain for Root,\" former England limited-overs captain Collingwood said on the Tuffers and Vaughan show.\n\"The captain will have leaders underneath him that he knows he can go to - I think Ben Stokes would be the perfect man for that.\"\nFast bowler Stuart Broad has also been mooted - he captained the Twenty20 side between 2011 and 2014 - and Anderson said: \"I wouldn't be against a fast bowler but one issue could be fitness.\n\"Bowlers get injured a lot more so are they going to play every game? The international schedule is hectic so it can be difficult.\"\nWicketkeeper Jos Buttler, who led the one-day side in Bangladesh in Morgan's absence and remains the official limited-overs vice-captain, has also been suggested as a possible candidate.\nHowever, the Lancashire player's Test place is not guaranteed given current keeper Jonny Bairstow's good form - although Buttler played as a specialist batsman in the last three Tests of the recent India series.\nEx-England spinner Graeme Swann told BBC Radio 5 live he felt the pressure of potential Test captaincy was already affecting Root's batting.\n\"I think we should leave Joe Root to be the best batsman this country has ever produced, which he would be without the burden of being the captain,\" he said.\nHowever, Kohli, along with Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, have each raised their games since becoming captains of their respective countries.\nSmith and Kohli are the two top-ranked Test batsmen, while Williamson is one of 13 men to have scored a Test century against all of the other nine Test-playing nations.\n\"It's very English to assume the captaincy will affect him. The other three have got captaincy of their country and gone to a different level with it,\" said ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan, who came through the same Sheffield Collegiate club side and Yorkshire academy ranks which produced Root, and has been a long-term mentor to the young right-hander.\n\"I don't think there's an issue with him captaining, he's too good a player. I think he'd be a good one.\n\"To captain any team you have to be loving the game, love the difficult moments and prove people wrong. He is that kind of character.\"\nEngland and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was named captain of the county in December 2016, said that his team-mate Root's inexperience was not an issue in him assuming the captaincy.\nThe pair lived together in 2011 during their early years in the Yorkshire first team and Ballance took Root's place when he was dropped for the final Test of England's Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14.\n\"I think both of us have probably matured a bit more as cricketers and people. He's ready as a leader now in that England changing room,\" Ballance told BBC World Service's Stumped programme.\n\"I think Rooty's a natural born leader. He's done it from a young age. People follow him.\n\"He speaks well, he's got a great cricket brain. I don't think inexperience is too much of a problem. He'll be ready if he gets the opportunity.\"\n\nSummary:"}

Summarize the following news article into one, concise sentence capturing the main point.\n\nArticle:\nThe first minister signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SinoFortone and another Chinese firm in March.\nAfter reports that the agreement has now been cancelled, the Scottish government highlighted a \"climate of hostility\" from opposition parties.\nOpponents of the deal called for a full statement on the \"sorry episode\".\nThe agreement, said to be worth up to £10bn, was signed with representatives of SinoFortone Group and China Railway No. 3 Engineering Group (CR3) at Nicola Sturgeon's official Bute House residence in Edinburgh.\nHowever opposition parties voiced fears about the deal, amid concerns CR3's parent company China Railway Group had been named in an Amnesty International report on human rights abuses and had been blacklisted by Norway's oil fund.\nMs Sturgeon said no specific deals would be done with the Chinese consortium if legitimate concerns were uncovered, with all actual investments to be scrutinised by the Scottish Parliament.\nThe Sunday Times newspaper reported the deal had collapsed in August and claimed it had become known in China as the \"Scottish shambles\".\nA spokesman for Economy Secretary Keith Brown said the government was aware of some concerns but had not thought the deal was off.\nHe also said opposition parties should be \"ashamed\" for putting potential investments at risk.\nThe spokesman said: \"We did not consider that the MOU had been cancelled but were aware that SinoFortone felt they could not move ahead at that time in the climate of hostility they faced from other parties.\n\"However, they continued to believe in the benefits for Scotland of an infrastructure partnership with China and we remained committed to pursuing these opportunities.\n\"The MOU is about building relationships with a view to investment and we remain committed to it. We are sorry if the partners consider the MOU to be cancelled and we remain open to working together on projects in the future.\"\nOpposition parties maintained their stance, with Labour's Jackie Baillie demanding the government \"come clean\" about the fate of the agreement \"as a matter of urgency\".\nShe said: \"Scotland deserves answers on this backroom deal - the whole affair poses serious questions about the transparency and competence of SNP ministers. The SNP government's handling of this has been cackhanded from the very beginning, so it is no wonder it has been branded a shambles.\n\"The SNP tried to hush up this deal throughout the election, and now we find out that it fell apart months ago, and yet the Scottish people - once again - were none the wiser.\"\nScottish Conservative economy spokesman Dean Lockhart added: \"This whole episode has shown the SNP just can't be trusted with economic matters. It thought it had struck gold, tried and failed to keep it a secret, and now doesn't seem to know what's going on.\n\"We now need a calm assessment of all this to see if a potentially lucrative deal with China can be reached. These things can't be allowed to fall through because of SNP bungling.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who lodged 28 parliamentary questions about the MOU on the first day of the new Holyrood term, also called for an \"urgent statement\" from Mr Brown about the affair.\nHe said: \"They must explain what recent discussions they have had with these Chinese companies, what lessons they have learned from this sorry episode and what new arrangements will be put in place to attract ethical investment for Scotland.\n\"The SNP has a chance to inject some much needed transparency for something that has been clouded in secrecy. Throughout this whole process groups such as Amnesty International and Transparency International expressed concerns but the SNP covered their ears and ploughed on regardless. The showed a casual disregard for human rights.\"\nThe Scottish government spokesman said opposition parties should be \"ashamed\", accusing them of \"doing Scotland down\".\nHe said: \"The opposition should be ashamed of themselves if their actions, in search of cheap headlines, have put up to £10bn of investment at risk.\n\"The Scottish government will do everything we can to make sure that Scotland is open for business.

Accordingly, I am writing to the defence secretary to ask him to take action to ensure that the neutrality of the armed forces is upheld.\"\nMr Corbyn, a leading member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, sparked a row with his shadow cabinet at his party's annual conference when he revealed that would never press the \"nuclear button\" - and he has since praised Scottish Labour's rejection of Trident.\nMr Corbyn has said he was elected Labour leader on a platform of opposing Trident renewal and that he is committed to \"promoting an international nuclear weapons convention which would lead to a nuclear-free world\".\nAsked about Mr Corbyn's refusal to use nuclear weapons, Sir Nicholas said: \"It would worry me if that thought was translated into power as it were.\"\nHe added: \"The whole thing about deterrence rests on the credibility of its use.\n\"When people say you're never going to use the deterrent, what I say is you use the deterrent every second of every minute of every day and the purpose of the deterrent is that you don't have to use it because you successfully deter.\n\"If a prime minister said they would never press the nuclear button, \"the deterrent is then completely undermined,\" he added.\n\"Most of the politicians I know understand that and I think that, dare I say, the responsibility of power is probably quite a sobering thing and you come to a realisation, 'I understand how this thing works'.\"\nAttending a wreath-laying ceremony in his Islington North constituency following the Remembrance Sunday commemorations at the Cenotaph, Mr Corbyn said Sir Nicholas's comments had been \"unhelpful\".\n\"I would gently say to him, with the greatest of respect, we live in a democracy where politicians are elected to Parliament in order to take political decisions,\" he told Channel 4 News.\n\"If he's worried, I think he should talk to me about it. I don't think it is appropriate for serving officers to make political comments or engage in political debate.\"\nShadow defence secretary Maria Eagle told Andrew Marr she was leading an \"open-minded\" review of the policy in light of Mr Corbyn's views and a vote by Scottish Labour against the renewal of Trident.\nShe said she had yet to meet Mr Corbyn to discuss Trident but a date was in her diary.\nBut she appeared to back Sir Nicholas, telling Andrew Marr: \"I understand the point that he is making. It is the point that I made myself when Jeremy said what he said.\"\nShe defended the right of Britain's most senior military figure to speak out on such a politically sensitive issue.\n\"I don't think there is anything wrong with him expressing himself in those terms,\" she said.\nShe indicated she could resign if there was any change to the party's current position in favour of renewing the Trident submarine fleet.\n\"I am not a unilateral nuclear disarmer. I don't believe that that works.\n\"I think I would find it difficult [to continue in the shadow cabinet] but we are not there yet. We have got a big process to go through,\" she said.\n\nSummary:"}

They asked GB Taekwondo to reconsider their choice of Lutalo Muhammad and the governing body returned with the same name, and, satisfied that proper selection procedures had been followed, the BOA didn't have much choice. That doesn't mean they're happy. They say they might revisit the matter should the international federation's investigation bring new issues to the fore. They're aware of the pressure this has put on both athletes and have criticised the apparent lack of transparency that has made GB Taekwondo's decision to leave out the world number one hard to understand.\n\"That said, after a thorough review, the panel is now sufficiently satisfied that the agreed selection procedures have been followed, and it is on that basis we are ratifying the nomination.\"\nGB Taekwondo welcomed the BOA decision.\nPerformance director Gary Hall said: \"This has been a long and difficult process for all involved, for the selection panel members and particularly for the two athletes concerned. Both are outstanding candidates and truly world class, both capable of winning medals in London. This has been the most difficult of selection decisions.\"\nCook's camp is now considering whether to launch legal action.\n\"Aaron is naturally incredibly disappointed with the BOA decision,\" said his agent Jamie Cunningham.\n\"He should be competing in the 2012 Games. It is an absolute disgrace that a British world number one has not been selected for the London Olympics by either his governing body or Olympic Association.\n\"He is world number one, European champion and has beaten 10 of the top 15 athletes in the Olympic rankings in his most recent fights. What more could Aaron have done?\n\"We urge the World Taekwondo Federation to consider the ramifications of this flawed decision. Aaron will be considering whether he wishes to pursue a legal route to contest this decision over the weekend.\"\nBob Mitchell, solicitor at Harbottle & Lewis representing Aaron Cook, added: \"Everyone is extremely disappointed by the outcome today. We have retained a leading sports QC and will be deciding over the weekend what the best way is to proceed for Aaron from a legal and sports perspective. A further statement is likely to be issued early next week.\"\nThe BOA's Olympic Qualification Standards panel can only accept or reject athlete nominations - it is not within its remit to select individual athletes.
