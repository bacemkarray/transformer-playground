Despite the length of Mr Dar's ordeal, he argues it created \"a window to move out of the area safely\".\nThe incident was filmed and shared on social media, causing uproar in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley.\nThe use of Mr Dar as a human shield was criticised around the world. Amnesty International described it as \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment amounting to torture\".\nThe Indian government announced there would be an inquiry into the incident but on 22 May, before the inquiry had been completed, the army awarded Major Gogoi a commendation medal for, it said, his \"sustained efforts during counter-insurgency operations\".\nThis incident shows just how difficult India is finding it to keep a lid on unrest in Kashmir.\nIndian army sources have told the BBC that morale among soldiers stationed in the valley is very low. Many any soldiers are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with their role in Kashmir, saying they fear they are effectively becoming an army of occupation.\nMeanwhile, opposition to Indian rule in Kashmir appears to be deepening. That is reflected in the fact that Mr Dar was just one of 7% of eligible voters who actually voted in the by-election - the lowest turnout for decades.\n\"We are fighting a legacy of political betrayal, infiltration, rigging in local elections, cynical politics, bad governance, vested interests, religion and regional divides,\" one senior army officer in Kashmir told my colleague, Soutik Biswas, a few weeks ago.\nThe officer acknowledged how difficult it is to operate in an environment where many people want the army to withdraw and said that, despite efforts to reach out to Kashmiris, the army remains unpopular.\nThis weekend the chief of the Indian army, General Bipin Rawat, was clear why he wanted to honour Major Gogoi.  He told the Press Trust of India (PTI) that the medal was given as a way of boosting the morale of young officers.\nGen Rawat served for many years in Kashmir and, like many Indians, believes much of the opposition to Indian rule is orchestrated by Pakistan.  He described Major Gogoi's actions as an \"innovation\", arguing the armed forces have the right to self-defence and that by using Mr Dar as a human shield, he avoided the need to fire on the crowd.\n\"This is a proxy war and a proxy war is a dirty war.

The latest figure for the inflation measure the Fed prefers was 1.1% in April, compared with its 2% target.\nThat it is so low reflects some transitory factors, including the strength of the dollar (which makes imported goods cheaper) and the decline in energy prices over the last two years. But in time, those factors cease to have a direct impact, so Ms Yellen expects inflation to move back towards 2%.\nShe also said that it's important not to attach too much significance to a single monthly jobs report. In short, a good report next month could bring interest rate rises a lot closer.\nSo while investors think the date of the next rate increase has gone further into the future as a result of the May jobs data, the Fed is always ready to change its plans if new figures change the picture.\nLooking at the US economy from a longer term perspective, it is a remarkable state of affairs that we should have rates still so close to record lows in a recovery that has been underway for several years.\nThe US economy started to grow again in the second half of 2009.

So what options do parents have?\nNappy bins are not always free - or available - across the UK.\nDorset, for example, recently introduced a £13 charge for an annual supply of nappy sacks, which are available for children up to age three.\nCouncils in Bournemouth and Poole let households of five people or more buy an extra bin for £43.\nKalpana Fitzpatrick, a journalist from London, thinks the charges are \"absolutely ridiculous\".

It features gradients of 20%, while stage 15 finishes at an altitude of 2,510m in Sierra Nevada. The penultimate stage pits the riders against the infamous Alto de Angliru, where Sky lost the 2011 Vuelta when Froome waited for team leader Bradley Wiggins as Juan Jose Cobo launched a race-winning attack.\nAn opening team time trial in Nimes should not be long enough to create any significant time gaps between those chasing the overall victory but crucial seconds will be won and lost.\nRace organisers will hope the 40km individual time trial on stage 16 will help balance out the climbs but it could just serve to strengthen Froome's grip on the title.\nSprinter-friendly stages are few, although those that make it to the finale are rewarded with a chance of glory in Madrid.\nIn a nutshell, he can climb with the best in the race and is a better time-trial rider. He has finished runner-up on three occasions and goes into the race saying he has \"unfinished business\".\nThe 32-year-old also has arguably the strongest nine-man squad to help keep him out of trouble on flatter stages and set the pace on the tougher ascents. And, given his excellent form in the third and final week of July's Tour de France, Froome appears to have tailored his season to perfection, allowing him to also peak for the Vuelta.\nOn the eve of the race, he said: \"The plan was to have a lighter first part of the season and I think that's worked. I certainly feel fresher. But whether that's reflected in the racing we'll have to wait and see.\"\nFroome's rivals know they need to attack on ascents and descents in the mountains in the hope of picking up enough seconds to neutralise the time they will expect to lose in the 40km individual time trial.\nAnd that stage 16 is one that Froome has earmarked. \"The time trial is one day I'm looking forward to, a lot of time can be won or lost there,\" he said. \"And of course stage 20 to the Angliru is a massive stage.\"\nRomain Bardet - the AG2R La Mondiale rider was the big hope for a first French Tour winner since 1985 in July, but he knows he needs to up his time trialling skills if he is to finally win a Grand Tour.\nHe lost almost two minutes to Froome over a 22km course in Marseille in July. Bardet, who is riding in his first Vuelta, said: \"My ambitions will be different than in the Tour de France but surrounded by a strong team, I hope to make an impact on stages that suit me.\"\nFabio Aru - the Italian won this race in 2015 and will love the steep climbs.

{"id": "val-850", "document": "How much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why.\nIt used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier.\nThis is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows.\nThen we had the financial crisis of 2008.\nThe upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them.\nFor example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of £27,000 at the age of 28, compared with £28,000 for those born in the 1970s.\nThe figure was £21,000 for those born in the 1960s and £15,000 for those born in the 1950s.\nDespite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age.\nBy their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about £27,000 each, on average.\nBy the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - £53,000 each.\nA large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither.\nAt the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s.\nHome ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30.\nSimilarly, the Local Government Association reported in December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago.\nThe lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices.\nIn their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs.\nAt the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by the decline of social housing.\nFor today's renters, it seems likely that raising a deposit is a greater barrier to home ownership than actually paying a mortgage.\nLower interest rates mean housing costs for young homeowners have fallen and they are quite likely to be paying much less than renters relative to their incomes.

Summarize the following news article into one, concise sentence capturing the main point.\n\nArticle:\nHow much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why.\nIt used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier.\nThis is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows.\nThen we had the financial crisis of 2008.\nThe upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them.\nFor example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of £27,000 at the age of 28, compared with £28,000 for those born in the 1970s.\nThe figure was £21,000 for those born in the 1960s and £15,000 for those born in the 1950s.\nDespite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age.\nBy their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about £27,000 each, on average.\nBy the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - £53,000 each.\nA large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither.\nAt the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s.\nHome ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30.\nSimilarly, the Local Government Association reported in December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago.\nThe lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices.\nIn their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs.\nAt the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by the decline of social housing.\nFor today's renters, it seems likely that raising a deposit is a greater barrier to home ownership than actually paying a mortgage.\nLower interest rates mean housing costs for young homeowners have fallen and they are quite likely to be paying much less than renters relative to their incomes. Mortgage interest costs for homeowners born in the early 1980s amounted to just 15% of income.\nOf course, the low interest rates that have benefitted homeowners are themselves likely to be one of the factors pushing up house prices.\nThe vast majority of young adults working in the private sector will never have pensions as generous as those enjoyed by their older colleagues.\nThis is because most employers have closed defined benefits pension schemes, which typically see employees paid a set proportion of their average or final salary when they retire.\nThe schemes that have replaced them are typically much less generous.\nIn their early thirties, fewer than one in 10 private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme.\nThis compares with nearly four out of 10 workers born in the 1960s.\nIn 2015, 90% of those in defined benefit schemes received an employer contribution equivalent to 10% of their earnings or more, compared with only 13% of those in other schemes.\nWith stalled incomes, lower home ownership and less generous pensions, it is easy to see that young adults have little to cheer about financially.\nBut those older, wealthier, generations are increasingly seen as the ones likely to provide a secure future.\nOf those people born in the 1970s, 75% have either received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis figure has grown steadily over the decades and has doubled since the 1930s, when just 38% of people expected an inheritance.\nOur data doesn't allow us to look at those born in the 1980s or 90s, but there is no reason to think this trend has not continued.\nWithin each generation, most inherited wealth goes to those who are already comparatively well-off.\nAmong the 1970s generation, nine out of 10 people whose income is in the top 20% have received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis compares with six out of 10 among those whose income is in the bottom 20%.\nData is not yet available for those born in the 80s or 90s.\nSo, for all the attention on inequality between generations, family ties mean a large chunk of the wealth held by older generations is likely to flow down to younger generations.\nBut most of that wealth will flow to those who are already well-off, potentially widening inequality within the younger generation.\nIt looks like we're heading for a future where how much wealth your parents have matters more than it used to.\nAbout this piece\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\nAndrew Hood is a senior research economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS), specialising in income, work and welfare.\nThe IFS describes itself as an independent research institute which aims to inform public debate on economics.

However, Margaret Thatcher is not alone among Westminster leaders in that regard.\nFor the most part, she was adored by her party in Scotland, just as in England.\nBut, even as they worshipped, quite a few Scottish Tories fretted that her politics would prove particularly divisive north of the border and thus electorally unpopular.\nRead more on Brian's blog\n\"Today, however, the proper reaction should be respect and condolences to her family.\"\nMs Davidson praised Lady Thatcher's policies, including extending the right for people to buy their council house.\nRuth Davidson said: \"She defended Britain's sovereignty, helped win the cold war, empowered thousands to own their own home by democratising property ownership and smashed the glass ceiling.\n\"My thoughts are with her family.\"\nScottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: \"I came into politics to fight the ideology and values of Margaret Thatcher which I believe damaged our country. But today is not a day to debate that.\n\"Today is a day to offer the deepest condolences to her family, friends and all who loved her.\n\"No-one can deny she made a deep mark on the history of this country.\"\nUnder Baroness Thatcher's leadership the Conservative government implemented social and economic policies which were unpopular in Scotland, including the Community Charge or poll tax.\nThe introduction of the poll tax, which took place in Scotland in 1989 - 12 months before the rest of the UK, led to widespread protests and a lasting animosity towards the Conservative party in Scotland.\nSir Malcolm Rifkind, served as Secretary of State for Scotland in her cabinet, said many of her major achievements also continued to be reflected in public opinion.\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"In a sense what made her so magnificent is occasionally what made her a very difficult and controversial character because she had very strong views, she put them forward uncompromisingly.\n\"She didn't mind being challenged, indeed she would listen with great care if she thought the person challenging her actually knew what they were talking about and she could change her mind and opinions, but only on the basis of solid evidence and solid argument.\n\"She would not be influenced by the fact it would be unpopular. That she despised, as well as disapproved of.\"\nBaroness Thatcher's economic policy was also praised by Iain McMillan, director of CBI Scotland. He said: \"It is all too easy to overlook the dreadful state that the UK economy was in at that time and the challenges that she and her government faced.\n\"Through sheer tenacity and immense courage, Margaret Thatcher changed the UK economy for the better and laid the ground for years of greatly improved economic performance.\"\nThe former chief political correspondent of the BBC, John Sergeant said: \"It's interesting that her two election campaigns that really mattered were 1979 and '83 - both of them started in Perth.

Summarize the following news article into one, concise sentence capturing the main point.\n\nArticle:\nDespite always affirming a strong bond with Scotland, she was a divisive political figure.\nFirst Minister Alex Salmond said Baroness Thatcher was \"truly formidable\".\nScottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, also paid tribute saying she was \"one of the truly great Prime Ministers\".\nMr Salmond said the former Conservative Party Prime Minister's \"policies defined a political generation\" for many people in Scotland.\n\"No doubt there will now be a renewed debate about the impact of that legacy\", he continued.\nBy Brian TaylorPolitical editor, Scotland\nShe never quite got Scotland.  However, Margaret Thatcher is not alone among Westminster leaders in that regard.\nFor the most part, she was adored by her party in Scotland, just as in England.\nBut, even as they worshipped, quite a few Scottish Tories fretted that her politics would prove particularly divisive north of the border and thus electorally unpopular.\nRead more on Brian's blog\n\"Today, however, the proper reaction should be respect and condolences to her family.\"\nMs Davidson praised Lady Thatcher's policies, including extending the right for people to buy their council house.\nRuth Davidson said: \"She defended Britain's sovereignty, helped win the cold war, empowered thousands to own their own home by democratising property ownership and smashed the glass ceiling.\n\"My thoughts are with her family.\"\nScottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: \"I came into politics to fight the ideology and values of Margaret Thatcher which I believe damaged our country. But today is not a day to debate that.\n\"Today is a day to offer the deepest condolences to her family, friends and all who loved her.\n\"No-one can deny she made a deep mark on the history of this country.\"\nUnder Baroness Thatcher's leadership the Conservative government implemented social and economic policies which were unpopular in Scotland, including the Community Charge or poll tax.\nThe introduction of the poll tax, which took place in Scotland in 1989 - 12 months before the rest of the UK, led to widespread protests and a lasting animosity towards the Conservative party in Scotland.\nSir Malcolm Rifkind, served as Secretary of State for Scotland in her cabinet, said many of her major achievements also continued to be reflected in public opinion.\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"In a sense what made her so magnificent is occasionally what made her a very difficult and controversial character because she had very strong views, she put them forward uncompromisingly.\n\"She didn't mind being challenged, indeed she would listen with great care if she thought the person challenging her actually knew what they were talking about and she could change her mind and opinions, but only on the basis of solid evidence and solid argument.\n\"She would not be influenced by the fact it would be unpopular. That she despised, as well as disapproved of.\"\nBaroness Thatcher's economic policy was also praised by Iain McMillan, director of CBI Scotland. He said: \"It is all too easy to overlook the dreadful state that the UK economy was in at that time and the challenges that she and her government faced.\n\"Through sheer tenacity and immense courage, Margaret Thatcher changed the UK economy for the better and laid the ground for years of greatly improved economic performance.\"\nThe former chief political correspondent of the BBC, John Sergeant said: \"It's interesting that her two election campaigns that really mattered were 1979 and '83 - both of them started in Perth. That's where she made her opening speech.\n\"So Scotland did matter to her a great deal, but she was always rather dismayed that she didn't do very well in Scotland.\n\"Her heart used to sink travelling north, as it did for Tony Blair. Once the poll tax was hung round her neck, and of course the miners dispute and everything else, she was always an amazingly divisive figure in Scotland and Tory fortunes north of the border never recovered from that early period.\"\n\nSummary:"}

{"id": "val-2029", "document": "Some might see  the claim by care home operators that there could be a \"catastrophic collapse\"  because of the higher costs associated with the National Living Wage in such a light.\nThe residential care providers might be accused in some quarters of crying wolf after their warnings that homes might close if ministers don't agree to fund increases in the bills paid by local authorities.\nThey have written to the Chancellor George Osborne just weeks after a similarly worded missive from the UK Homecare Association, which represents providers of social care to people in their homes.\nAnd yet...

They have 28 days to appeal against their bans to the High Court.\nLast November, a panel recommended teaching bans, after concluding pupils had been \"immersed in orthodox Islamic doctrine\" through measures including the use of the school loudspeaker system to broadcast a daily call-to-prayer to Park View's pupils.\nThe panel also found while there was no formal agreement to change the character of the schools involved, there had been a co-ordinated attempt at the state-funded schools to include \"undue religious influence\".\nIt further found no evidence of Islamic \"extremism\" at work in the classrooms.\nThirteen former staff members including ex-head teachers at Park View Educational Trust (PVET) and Oldknow Academy have been facing misconduct hearings, as a result of the scandal's fallout.\nThe panel said it had heard \"credible\" evidence from a staff member who described the two men's roles as that of \"generals\" in contributing to making sure pupils were \"fed a diet of Islam\".\nThe panel also found their conduct tended to undermine tolerance and respect for the faith and belief of others.\nSeparately, Mr Anwar was also found to have breached proper recruitment procedures at Park View's sister school Nansen Primary.\nPark View, part of PVET, was at the centre of anonymous allegations which claimed there was a wider plot by Muslim hard-liners to take control of several Birmingham schools.\nThe allegations sparked investigations by several agencies, including the Department for Education and Ofsted.\nFollowing the scandal, Park View Academy was placed in special measures by Ofsted. It has since been renamed Rockwood Academy.\n\nSummary:"}

He was part of our culture and I used to love listening to him on the television.\"\nShe said she did not report the incident or call the police that day because she did not think anybody would believe her allegations against \"an extremely popular man\".\nThe defence lawyer asked if she had fabricated her story in the hope of making money.\nShe replied: \"Certainly not sir\" and added, \"I wouldn't choose to be here\".\nThe trial continues.\n\nSummary:"}

{"id": "val-1566", "document": "New by-laws will \"regulate\" camping in three zones in the park - West Loch Lomond, Trossachs (West) and Trossachs (North).\nThe authority said the plans only affected 3.7% of the national park and included investment in new facilities.\nBut the by-laws have been criticised by many outdoor recreation groups.\nThose opposed to the legislation, including Ramblers Scotland and the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, said they were concerned the laws would damage access rights.\nThe seasonal by-laws, which come into effect next year, will be active from 1 March to 30 September.\nThey will cover much of the west side of Loch Lomond, the northern tip of Loch Long and many of the Trossachs lochs, including Loch Earn, Loch Venachar and Loch Lubnaig.\nThe national park convener Linda McKay said: \"This is tremendously positive news for all those who, like us, want to protect and enhance some of Scotland's most precious natural places.\n\"These carefully-considered proposals reflect the views of a wide body of interests and demonstrate the delicate balance that needs to be struck when caring for our national parks.\"\nAs part of the plans, 300 low-cost camping places will be introduced. Some of the sites will be new or improved camping facilities and in other areas permits will be issued which will allow \"informal\" lochshore camping at \"sustainable levels\".\nThe national park said the by-laws were necessary to tackle anti-social behaviour. They will also make it an offence to cause damage to the natural environment and prevent long-term encampments in lay-bys.\nBut some outdoor groups have greeted the Scottish government announcement with \"disappointment\".\nKim Atkinson, chief executive officer of the Scottish Sports Association said: \"Our Outdoors Pursuits Group (OPG) members have always acknowledged that there are significant problems arising from certain roadside camping activities which take place along loch shores within the national park.\n\"However, our OPG remains unconvinced that by-laws are the solution, and remains concerned that they will undermine Scotland's much-prized access legislation.\"\nJess Dolan, director of Ramblers Scotland, said the new by-laws would penalise the \"vast majority\" who camped responsibly.\nShe said: \"This is a sad day for everyone who holds Scottish access rights dear.

Summarize the following news article into one, concise sentence capturing the main point.\n\nArticle:\nNew by-laws will \"regulate\" camping in three zones in the park - West Loch Lomond, Trossachs (West) and Trossachs (North).\nThe authority said the plans only affected 3.7% of the national park and included investment in new facilities.\nBut the by-laws have been criticised by many outdoor recreation groups.\nThose opposed to the legislation, including Ramblers Scotland and the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, said they were concerned the laws would damage access rights.\nThe seasonal by-laws, which come into effect next year, will be active from 1 March to 30 September.\nThey will cover much of the west side of Loch Lomond, the northern tip of Loch Long and many of the Trossachs lochs, including Loch Earn, Loch Venachar and Loch Lubnaig.\nThe national park convener Linda McKay said: \"This is tremendously positive news for all those who, like us, want to protect and enhance some of Scotland's most precious natural places.\n\"These carefully-considered proposals reflect the views of a wide body of interests and demonstrate the delicate balance that needs to be struck when caring for our national parks.\"\nAs part of the plans, 300 low-cost camping places will be introduced. Some of the sites will be new or improved camping facilities and in other areas permits will be issued which will allow \"informal\" lochshore camping at \"sustainable levels\".\nThe national park said the by-laws were necessary to tackle anti-social behaviour. They will also make it an offence to cause damage to the natural environment and prevent long-term encampments in lay-bys.\nBut some outdoor groups have greeted the Scottish government announcement with \"disappointment\".\nKim Atkinson, chief executive officer of the Scottish Sports Association said: \"Our Outdoors Pursuits Group (OPG) members have always acknowledged that there are significant problems arising from certain roadside camping activities which take place along loch shores within the national park.\n\"However, our OPG remains unconvinced that by-laws are the solution, and remains concerned that they will undermine Scotland's much-prized access legislation.\"\nJess Dolan, director of Ramblers Scotland, said the new by-laws would penalise the \"vast majority\" who camped responsibly.\nShe said: \"This is a sad day for everyone who holds Scottish access rights dear. The national park itself has admitted that most of the anti-social problems arising from some camping activities are caused by a lack of infrastructure and enforcement of existing legislation.\n\"Therefore we are disappointed that the minister has decided to approve by-laws, albeit with a short delay before they come into effect.\"\nMs Dolan added that Ramblers Scotland would be working to ensure the legislation was not renewed when it comes up for review in three years' time.\nAnd Dave Gibson, chief executive officer for the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, argued the national park and police already had the powers they needed to tackle lochside problems.\n\"We believe that an outcome of the by-laws will be that they will criminalise those who would otherwise wish to exercise their rights to wild camp responsibly under the terms of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003,\" he said.\n\"As such, this decision goes against the rights to responsible access provided in the act.\"\nHowever, the national park's plan has seen widespread support from residents of the park.\nRichard Graham, chairman of St Fillans Community Council, said: \"This is great news, not only for the communities who have had to put up with environmental degradation and anti-social behaviour for years, but also for the visitors who have been put off spending time in these 'no go' zones.\n\"We've seen the restorative effect that dealing with the similar issues had on East Loch Lomond and look forward to seeing families, responsible campers and visitors return to areas like ours, which have been blighted by these problems for too long.\"\nThe new by-laws are rooted in a \"Five Lochs\" study, which originally looked at problems around Loch Venachar, Loch Lubnaig, Loch Earn, Loch Achray and Loch Voil.\nThe study followed an alcohol ban and restricted camping along parts of east Loch Lomond, introduced in 2011.
